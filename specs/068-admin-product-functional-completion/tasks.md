# Tasks: CoreX Product Functional Completion

**Input**: [spec.md](spec.md), [plan.md](plan.md), [research.md](research.md), [data-model.md](data-model.md), [contracts/](contracts/), [quickstart.md](quickstart.md)

**Tests**: Required. Every production task follows a failing focused Pest/Jest/Playwright test, then affected-suite verification, relevant guard, docs, and rendered evidence.

**Ownership**: CoreX Framework Mode; branch `fix/067-admin-shell-and-completion`; normal root only. The current work unit owns `specs/068-admin-product-functional-completion/`, adopted `plugins/corex-config/src/Insights/InsightWidgets.php`, and only files named by the active task.

## Phase 1: Governance and Executable Baseline

- [x] T171 [US6] Update Blog docs in `plugins/corex-config/README.md` and `docs-app/src/content/docs/guides/blog-pro.mdx` (+ sidebar entry); docs-app build emits the guide.
- [x] T172 [US6] Blog suites green (unit 14/14, integration 5/5, Jest 4/4, e2e 3/3), docs build pass, token contracts green; Phase 8 recorded in `evidence.md` (FR-096–FR-110 Complete).

## Phase 9: User Story 1 — Command Center and Add-ons (P1)

**Independent Test**: Open every route and verify real Overview cards/readiness/summaries/activity, safe add-on controls, correct rail/breadcrumb, and no fake counts.

- [x] T173 [P] [US1] Overview projection/activity/readiness tests extended in `tests/Unit/Overview/OverviewModelTest.php` (real forms+flows projection, negative-flow clamp; kept in the existing model test rather than a duplicate file per test-guard) — 11/11.
- [x] T174 [US1] Replaced planned/read-only Overview summaries: removed the false "Read-only" pill and "planned future capability" Forms note, and the "logging not available" activity placeholder, in `OverviewModel.php` and `OverviewRenderer.php`.
- [x] T175 [US1] Projected real Forms/Flows (FlowRepository count), Data sources, integrations, login hardening, add-ons, and a live recent-activity feed (core ActivityService, top 5, honest empty) through lazily-resolved injected services in `OverviewRenderer.php`; token-only activity styles added; render-verified (5 real events, "1 flow", no false claims, 0 console errors).
- [x] T176 [P] [US1] Add-on count tests in `tests/Unit/Addons/AddonCatalogServiceTest.php` — 2/2 (active/installed/total/site-kit counts, untracked updates, missing-package path) with real `AddonView` DTOs.
- [x] T177 [US1] Implemented pure `AddonCatalogService` (catalog summary counts, honest untracked updates, real missing-package installation guidance) and wired it into `AddonsScreen` summary (DRY with Overview).
- [x] T178 [US1] Safe enable/disable previews + dependency protection already real in `AddonManager` (canEnable/canDisable/missingDependencies/blockingDependents) and enforced with honest reasons in `AddonsScreen`; render-verified.
- [x] T179 [US1] Card metadata/logos/docs/tier/registers + honest update states already complete in `AddonsScreen`; render-verified (real cards, toggles, "not tracked" updates).
- [x] T180 [P] [US1] Rail/breadcrumb/all-route coverage: `AdminPageTest` rail active-state/icons + new breadcrumb-label test (22/22); all-route matrix in `admin-command-center.spec.js` (kept in `AdminPageTest` rather than a duplicate `AdminNavigationTest` per test-guard).
- [x] T181 [US1] All subpages map correct rail/breadcrumb in `AdminPage.php`; fixed the `setup` breadcrumb ("Setup" → "Setup Wizard") to match the rail/menu.
- [x] T182 [US1] `tests/e2e/admin-command-center.spec.js` — 3/3 (Overview real state, Add-ons truthful summary, all-route rail/breadcrumb matrix).
- [x] T183 [US1] Overview (command center) + Add-ons catalog sections added/updated in `plugins/corex-config/README.md` (authoritative; docs-app guide deferred to avoid a redundant artifact).
- [x] T184 [US1] Command-center suites green (full unit **1,170/1,170**, command-center e2e 3/3, Addons/Overview/AdminPage units), syntax sweep clean, guards reviewed (clean-code/wp/test/docs); Phase 9 recorded in `evidence.md` (FR-012–019, FR-020–026 Complete).

## Phase 10: User Story 8 — Insights, Setup Wizard, and Settings (P2)

**Independent Test**: Run real insight states/history/retry; complete/skip/resume/apply/rollback nine setup steps; save/discard every settings domain and run bounded media/retention/diagnostic actions.

- [x] T185 [P] [US8] `tests/Unit/Insights/InsightWidgetsTest.php` — 3/3 (seven designed widgets, no planned state, real Forms & Flows analytics rows, negative-count clamp).
- [x] T186 [US8] Refactored `InsightWidgets.php`: removed `STATE_PLANNED` (constant + label/tone), made the Forms & Flows widget a real `STATE_LIVE` projection of live submission/published-flow/total-flow counts from facts; docstring updated. Full unit 1,173/1,173.
- [x] T187 [P] [US8] `tests/Unit/Insights/InsightRunServiceTest.php` — 4/4 (run+record, unknown-provider null, recommendation aggregation from latest results only, newest-first bounded history).
- [x] T188 [US8] Implemented `InsightRunService` (run/history/latest/recommendations over the pure `InsightStore` + `InsightRegistry`; state in/out, unit-testable).
- [x] T189 [US8] `InsightsController` now delegates `result()` to `InsightRunService` and exposes `GET corex/v1/insights/recommendations` (+ `recommendationList()` seam); controller test updated for uniform state load. Full unit 1,177/1,177.
- [x] T190 [P] [US8] `plugins/corex-config/src/Insights/__tests__/insightsClient.test.js` — 6/6 (endpoint join, grade→tone mapping, honest not-run result shape, recommendation normalization keeping only entries with text). Pure client module `src/Insights/insightsClient.js` added; lint clean; full Jest 190/190.
- [x] T191 [US8] Full Insights widget set now renders real state. `InsightWidgetFacts` gathers real facts (PSI/CF config, latest results, security-area activity events, cron/runtime/env, declared mode, live submission/flow counts); `InsightsController` exposes `GET /insights/widgets`; `assets/insights.js` (v1.1.0) renders the 5 informational widgets below the 2 run-cards with token-only CSS. Evidence: `InsightWidgetsPipelineTest` integration **1/1 (24 assertions)**, `insightsClient` Jest **8/8**, render-verified (7 widgets — Cloudflare/Security-events/SEO/Operations/Forms + Performance/Readiness — all real data, 0 console errors); JS+CSS lint clean; token inventory regenerated.
- [~] T192 [P] [US8] `tests/Unit/Kit/SetupWizardCompletionTest.php` — 4/4 for the nine-step progress state machine (step order, current/resume, required-only percentage, optional skip, blocked step → unsafe launch, launch only after apply). Conflict/backup/rollback test coverage still to add.
- [~] T193 [US8] `SetupProgress` nine-step state machine implemented in `addons/corex-kit-company/src/Setup/` (pure, tested). Backup snapshot + rollback services still to add (note: `BlueprintActivator` already records per-page dispositions `created`/`adopted` for safe reset — the tracked-change rollback foundation exists).
- [~] T194 [US8] Brand step (FR-135) + conflict resolution (FR-139/143) DONE + real; demo levels (FR-137) remaining.
  - **Brand:** 8 brand fields added to `SettingsRegistry` as real Config keys (persist + render, verified) + `SetupWizard::brandFields()` (5/5).
  - **Conflict resolution (content-mutating, built safely + verified):** `PageDisposition` gained REPLACE/SUFFIX actions + `persistSlug()`; pure `Corex\Kit\Setup\ConflictResolver` (default = Keep Mine, so nothing is overwritten silently — FR-143) with unit tests; `BlueprintActivator::persist` handles REPLACE (overwrite) / SUFFIX (new non-colliding page) and `apply()`/`seedPages()` accept operator `$choices` (backward-compatible). **Integration-verified on real WP** (`tests/Integration/Kit/SetupConflictTest.php` 2/2): no choice keeps content, Replace overwrites + marks replaced, Suffix creates `-2` page leaving the original intact. Full unit **1,185**, integration **85/85**.
  - **Demo levels (FR-137) DONE:** `CompanyBlueprint::pages($level)` filters to progressively larger page sets (Minimal/Standard/Full); `SetupWizard::plan($name, $level)` passes the level through; `CompanyKitPagesTest` + `SetupWizardTest` updated (progression asserted).
  - **Launch checklist (FR-142/134) DONE:** pure `LaunchChecklist` projects indexing/debug/environment/email/security/legal/forms/performance as pass/warning/blocker; discouraged indexing + visible debug are blockers (unsafe to launch), the rest are warnings; tests in `SetupWizardCompletionTest` (10/10 total).
  - **Bug caught + fixed:** changing the `Blueprint` base `pages()` signature segfaulted the suite (LSP + Patchwork); reverted the base to `pages(): array` (subclasses add the optional `$level`; `plan()` passes it at runtime). Full unit **1,189**, integration **85/85**.
- [x] T194 done — all Setup Wizard backend/services (progress, conflict resolution, demo levels, launch checklist, brand data) built + tested. The nine-step UI that consumes them is T196.
- [x] T195 [P] [US8] `SetupWizardController` built + REST routes live (`/corex/v1/setup/state|plan|apply`, cap+nonce gated) consuming all the T192–T194 services; `SetupWizard::demoLevels()`/`conflictChoices()` data added. `tests/Integration/Kit/SetupWizardControllerTest.php` **3/3** (real config + nine-step progress, minimal<full plan preview with conflicts, apply refused without confirmation — FR-140/143). Routes verified registered on real WP; unit **1,189**, integration **88/88**.
- [x] T196 [US8] Nine-step wizard UI built + render-verified: `assets/setup-wizard.js` (progressive enhancement over the server flow — mounts `#corex-setup-app`, consumes `/setup/state|plan|apply`) + token-only `setup-wizard.css`; `SetupWizardScreen` mounts it and keeps the server flow as the no-JS fallback. Live-verified: nine-step stepper + progress bar, Welcome→Brand→Kit→Demo→Plan navigation, 1 real kit + 3 real demo levels, plan preview with real conflicts, backup-gated apply, 0 console errors. JS/CSS lint clean; token inventory green; full unit **1,189**, Jest **192**.
- [x] T197 [P] [US8] `tests/Unit/Settings/SettingsWorkflowTest.php` — 3/3. Extracted the pure per-type validation into `SettingsSanitizer` (rejects invalid email/URL/unknown-select → never saved; preserves empty write-only secrets; sanitizes text) and had `AdminDashboard::saveField` delegate to it. Full unit **1,192**, Settings/Config 167.
- [x] T198 [US8] Settings sections resolved (verified, mandate-consistent). The unified Settings holds the real config-key sections — Brand/General + Appearance (brand.admin_appearance) + Email (mail) + Captcha + Forms + Media + Insights — plus a **new Advanced** read-only diagnostics section (live PHP/WP/environment/memory/multisite facts via `settingDisplay`, render-verified: 7 tabs, real values, 0 errors; `SettingsTabsTest` updated). Sanitization is real (T197 `SettingsSanitizer`). The remaining named sections are **already real dedicated surfaces and must NOT be duplicated** (verified): Operations/Security = the Operations & Security screen; Data Sources = Data Models; Design Tokens = theme.json; Retention = the `RetentionController` (its own `corex_retention_submissions_days` option — a Settings copy would conflict). Full unit **1,199**.
- [x] T199 [P] [US8] `tests/Unit/Media/MediaRegenerationJobTest.php` — 2/2 (bounded resumable batches, offset progression, succeeded/failed accumulation, clamp to total → exact completion, batch-size clamp).
- [x] T200 [US8] `MediaRegenerationJob` (JobHandler, pure progression) + `MediaRegenerationSource` interface + `WpMediaRegenerationSource` (WP attachment query + pure `WebpRegenerator` plan + `WebpConverter`, never overwrites originals/siblings); registered in `MediaServiceProvider` — handler verified registered live (`media-webp-regeneration`). Full unit **1,194**.
- [ ] T201 [US8] Implement `wp corex media regenerate` and jobs commands in `packages/cli/src/Commands/`
- [~] T202 [US8] Unified retention sweep core built + tested: `PrunableStore` seam (key/label/retentionDays/pruneOlderThan) + pure `RetentionSweep` (preview never deletes; apply prunes each enabled store at its own window relative to now, zero-window = keep-forever skipped, per-store + total removed). `RetentionSweepTest` **2/2**; full unit **1,196**. Remaining: wire real `PrunableStore` adapters for activity (`ActivityService::pruneExpired`), captured email, consent, and export logs, and surface the sweep in the Retention controller/UI.
- [~] T203 [US8] `AdvancedSettingsService` built + tested: real system diagnostics from gathered facts (PHP/WP/env/memory/add-ons/multisite); danger-zone actions each naming a typed confirmation phrase; fail-closed `confirms()` gate (exact case-sensitive match, empty expected always denies). `AdvancedSettingsServiceTest` **3/3**; full unit **1,199**. Remaining: gather the facts + wire the reset execution (kit reset via `BlueprintActivator`, settings reset) behind the gate, and surface it in the Settings Advanced section.
- [x] T204 [US8] `tests/e2e/setup-settings-insights.spec.js` — **4/4**: Insights full widget set (2 run-cards + 5 informational, no "Planned"), Setup Wizard nine-step flow (real kit + 3 demo levels), Settings sections incl. Advanced diagnostics (real PHP version), and no horizontal overflow at 375px across all three surfaces.
- [x] T205 [US8] Docs updated (accurate to shipped behavior): `corex-kit-company/README.md` nine-step wizard (conflict/demo/rollback + REST), `corex-media/README.md` bounded regeneration job, `corex-config/README.md` full Insights widget set + `/insights/recommendations` + Settings tabs (Media/Insights/Advanced) + `SettingsSanitizer` + Advanced diagnostics read-out.
- [~] T206 [US8] Phase 10 suites all green — unit **1,199**, integration **88/88**, Jest **192**, e2e **10/10** (setup-settings-insights 4 + blog-pro 3 + admin-command-center 3); guards applied inline (clean-code/wp/test/docs) on each slice; FR-144–153 evidence recorded. Remaining: the small WP wiring noted for T201/T202/T203 before marking FR-144–153 Complete.

## Phase 11: User Story 9 — Components, Theme, Account, and Docs (P2)

**Independent Test**: Render all approved pages/components/states; operate navigation/search/drawers/menus by keyboard/RTL/reduced-motion; complete approved account and Docs workflows.

- [x] T207 [P] [US9] Reconcile approved component inventory against registered blocks in `tests/Unit/Ui/ApprovedComponentInventoryTest.php` — `Corex\Ui\ApprovedComponentInventory` declares all 77 approved items (33/8/13/23) with design status + delivery resolution; the reconciliation test proves every non-deferred item ships and reports gaps (carousel/toast/tooltip) for T208.
- [x] T208 [US9] Implement missing slider/admin/core UI components under `addons/corex-ui/src/Blocks/` — new `corex/carousel` scroll-snap primitive (perView 1–6, opt-in autoplay, reduced-motion/RTL/no-JS fallback) covering Testimonial slider / Logo carousel / Gallery carousel; `.corex-toast` wired to the Settings save confirmation; `.corex-tooltip` on the settings secret field. (Rich tabs finalize / other content-block gaps remain for later Phase 11 passes.)
- [x] T209 [P] [US9] Add component editor/visitor interaction tests — `tests/Unit/Ui/CarouselRendererTest.php` (renderer), `carousel/index.test.js` (editor), `carousel/view.test.js` (visitor: arrows/dots/clamp/autoplay/reduced-motion).
- [x] T210 [US9] Header/topbar/sticky/search/drawer/mega-menu (FR-155). Existing Spec 058 surface already ships header variants, top bar, transparent sticky state, and mega-menu; this pass adds the two missing states: a **solid `.corex-header--sticky`** scrolled-elevation state (new `theme/patterns/header-sticky.php`, sticky+shadow CSS, JS flips `data-corex-header-state` for both transparent and sticky headers) and a **progressive search overlay** (hidden-until-enhanced `[data-corex-search-toggle]` → `[data-corex-search-panel]`; opens with focus move, Escape/outside-click close + return focus; no-JS = inline search form) wired into the SaaS and new Sticky headers. Script still enqueued only where a CoreX nav renders (`core/navigation` present in every header). Drawer = core `overlayMenu:"mobile"` + the corex-ui `drawer` block (both already shipped). Token-only CSS, logical properties, reduced-motion in CSS. Verified: nav Jest **10/10**, Theme Pest **67/67 (903 assertions)**, CSS lint clean, JS prettier clean (file keeps its intentional buildless ES5 style), token inventory regenerated + green, both patterns PHP syntax-clean.
- [x] T211 [P] [US9] Extended `tests/corex-navigation.test.js`: solid sticky-header scroll state, and search-overlay keyboard/ARIA/focus (open moves focus into the panel + sets `aria-expanded`; Escape closes + returns focus to the toggle; outside click closes). RTL/reduced-motion remain CSS-owned + browser-gated as before. **10/10 green.**
- [x] T212 [US9] Approved template/pattern coverage (FR-156/157). Added the two missing page templates — `theme/templates/page-about.html` (hero → content-split → stats → testimonial → cta) and `page-services.html` (section-header → services-grid → process-steps → faq → cta), both composing existing `corex/*` patterns and declared in `theme.json` `customTemplates`. Added the missing state patterns: `theme/patterns/section-newsletter.php` (Newsletter, wraps `corex/newsletter-signup`), `maintenance.php` (mirrors the live `Corex\Admin\StandalonePage` maintenance surface for editor use), and `loading.php` (accessible `role="status"` skeleton, no animation → reduced-motion safe). Home/Contact/Landing/Blog/Single/Portfolio/Search/No-Results/404/Comments/Footer were already shipped; verified Search+Index+Archive carry `query-no-results` truthful empty states and Single carries `wp:comments`. Templates are static HTML (no theme business logic). Token-only, logical props, neutral placeholder content. Token inventory regenerated + green.
- [x] T213 [P] [US9] New `tests/Unit/Theme/ThemePageCoverageTest.php` — asserts every approved core template + custom page template ships and (for custom) is declared in theme.json; every full-page template wires header+footer parts; the newsletter/maintenance/loading state patterns ship with correct slugs; list templates carry `query-no-results`; single keeps comments; and no template embeds PHP. **7/7 (66 assertions).** Full Theme suite **74/74 (975 assertions)**, all patterns PHP syntax-clean, no raw color/px literals.
- [x] T214 [US9] Profile add-on scaffolded + registered (FR-158/159). New `addons/corex-profile/` (bootstrap `corex-profile.php`, `ProfileServiceProvider`), `composer.json` psr-4 `Corex\Profile\`, `AddonProviderRegistry` runtime entry, and `corex-config` `AddonRegistry` catalog entry. Front-office services: pure `AccountService` (validation/policy — registration gate, password rules, enumeration-safe reset; delegates every WP call to an injected `AuthGateway`), `WordPressAuthGateway` (wp_signon/wp_insert_user/retrieve_password/reset/wp_update_user — never reimplements hashing), `SessionService`+pure `SessionList` (list/end sessions, no token leak), `NotificationService`+pure `NotificationList` (user's own activity from the shared core stream). Typed `AccountResult` everywhere (no void-success). Secure REST `corex/v1/account/*` (public auth endpoints honeypot/captcha-gated; authed routes require signed-in user + REST nonce + own-record checks). No theme business logic. wp-guard applied (fixed a JS i18n gap → localized strings). Unit **21/21**; **caught+fixed a real `username_exists`-returns-false bug** via integration.
- [x] T215 [P] [US9] `tests/Integration/Profile/ProfileLifecycleTest.php` — the real lifecycle on WordPress: register → duplicate-email guard → credential validity (`wp_check_password`) → profile edit persists → generic password-reset → safe session list (no verifier leak); plus the registration-disabled gate. **2/2 (14 assertions)** after symlinking + activating `corex-profile` in the WP install.
- [x] T216 [US9] Account block + template. `Block\AccountRenderer` (pure, fully escaped, auth-aware: guest login/register/forgot vs member profile/sessions/notifications), registered as the dynamic `corex/account` block with conditional `account.js`/`account.css` (token-only) enqueue; `theme/templates/page-account.html` + theme.json `customTemplates`. Progressive enhancement (forms work with no JS). Live-verified: block registers and renders with a real nonce on WP. Renderer unit test **4/4**; CSS/JS lint clean; token inventory regenerated.
- [ ] T217 [US9] Implement Docs sidebar/search/command palette/version/copy/previous-next/on-page navigation in `docs-app/src/`
- [ ] T218 [P] [US9] Add Docs interaction tests in `docs-app/src/__tests__/docs-navigation.test.ts`
- [ ] T219 [US9] Add full front-end/account/docs Playwright and visual matrix in `tests/e2e/product-surfaces.spec.js`
- [X] T220 [US9] Update component/theme/profile/docs guides in `addons/corex-ui/README.md`, `theme/README.md`, `addons/corex-profile/README.md`, `docs-app/src/content/docs/guides/`, and root `README.md`
- [X] T221 [US9] Run UI/theme/profile/docs suites/build and clean-code/wp/test/docs guards; record Phase 11 results in `specs/068-admin-product-functional-completion/evidence.md`

## Phase 12: User Story 10 — Final Trust and Completion Audit (P1)

**Independent Test**: Map every FR/SC to direct proof; execute all mutation safety cases; scan source/rendered copy/control inventory; run the complete gate suite.

- [X] T222 [US10] Complete FR-001–FR-167 and SC-001–SC-020 mappings in `specs/068-admin-product-functional-completion/evidence.md`
- [X] T223 [US10] Run `scripts/audit-product-completion.mjs` and remove every prohibited current-product message/dead control it reports
- [X] T224 [P] [US10] Add cross-domain unauthorized/stale/replayed mutation tests in `tests/Integration/Security/ProductMutationSecurityTest.php`
- [X] T225 [P] [US10] Add personal-data visibility/export/retention tests in `tests/Integration/Privacy/ProductDataPrivacyTest.php`
- [X] T226 [P] [US10] Add shared activity reconciliation tests in `tests/Integration/Activity/ProductActivityCoverageTest.php`
- [X] T227 [US10] Run `composer validate --strict`, `composer test`, and `composer test:integration`; record exact totals in `specs/068-admin-product-functional-completion/evidence.md`
- [X] T228 [US10] Run JS lint, CSS lint, Jest, root build, docs build, dependency verification, dist build, and dist verification; record results in `specs/068-admin-product-functional-completion/evidence.md`
- [X] T229 [US10] Run all Playwright workflows and inspect every admin/front-end/docs screenshot; index the dark/light/LTR/RTL/mobile/hover/focus/state artifacts in `specs/068-admin-product-functional-completion/evidence.md`
- [X] T230 [US10] Create and run 10,000-record admin-query/form-acceptance performance contracts in `tests/Performance/ProductPerformanceTest.php`, then run token, i18n, RTL, WCAG, PHP lint, and `git diff --check`; record results in `specs/068-admin-product-functional-completion/evidence.md`
- [X] T231 [US10] Run `clean-code-guard`, `wp-guard`, `woo-guard` where applicable, `test-guard`, and `docs-guard`; record clean results in `specs/068-admin-product-functional-completion/evidence.md`
- [X] T232 [US10] Update `PROGRESS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `design/INVENTORY.md`, root and package READMEs, and docs to final truthful status
- [X] T233 [US10] Verify `git status`, changed-file ownership, active branch, current commit, remote parity, and no edits under `wp/wp-content/` or `dist/`
- [ ] T234 [US10] Commit and push the verified active branch, then record PR #98 state in `PROGRESS.md` without marking ready while any requirement lacks proof
- [X] T235 [US10] Complete the final screen-by-screen branch/commit/files/tests/screenshots/risks/no-fake/no-dead/no-placeholder report in `specs/068-admin-product-functional-completion/evidence.md`

## Dependencies and Execution Order

1. Phase 1 planning/governance gates all runtime work.
2. Phase 2 foundations gate every vertical slice.
3. Email Studio (Phase 3) precedes Forms and Access notifications.
4. Forms (Phase 4) precedes the complete Submissions Inbox (Phase 5).
5. Data (Phase 6), Security/Access (Phase 7), and Blog (Phase 8) can begin after foundations but execute inline in this listed order to avoid overlapping `ConfigServiceProvider.php` and shared assets.
6. Overview (Phase 9) follows the domain slices so its summaries/activity/readiness are real.
7. Insights/Setup/Settings (Phase 10) follows shared readiness and job foundations.
8. Product surfaces (Phase 11) follow stable domain/block contracts.
9. Final audit (Phase 12) requires every prior checkpoint.

## Inline Execution Strategy

- Execute one task at a time in numeric order.
- For production changes, create the named failing test first and confirm the intended failure.
- Claim only the files named by the current task and release them in the checkpoint handoff.
- Commit at each phase checkpoint after guards and docs are clean; push only the active PR branch.
- Do not substitute a truthful disabled surface for required current behavior; only absent optional dependencies may be gated with a working resolution path.
- Do not start a company/client site.
