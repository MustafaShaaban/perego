# Tasks: Pre-Site Asset & Media Hardening (spec 062)

`[x]` done in PR A (this branch) · `[ ]` PR B (immediately after) or deferred Priority 2.

## PR A — Asset helper foundation + generated client pipeline + asset docs

### T001 — Spec Kit
- [x] spec.md / plan.md / tasks.md.

### T002 — Asset helpers (FR-062-01)
- [x] T002a `Corex\Assets\AssetRegistry` (named bases → AssetManager; default; test seam) + binding.
- [x] T002b `Corex\Assets\ScriptOptions` (pure: deps/in_footer/strategy=defer|async/module/version + `.asset.php`).
- [x] T002c `Corex\Assets\Style` facade — resolve url+version, enqueue, **reject `.scss`**.
- [x] T002d `Corex\Assets\Script` facade — enqueue with strategy/module/in_footer/deps/version + `.asset.php`.
- [x] T002e `Corex\Assets\Image` facade — `tag()` `<img>` + `picture()` `<picture>` (source-controlled `.webp` sibling).
- [x] T002f Tests: AssetRegistry, ScriptOptions, Style scss-guard + url/version, Script attrs/.asset.php, Image/Picture.

### T003 — Generated client SCSS/JS/image pipeline (FR-062-02) — PR B
- [x] T003a `make:site --starter`: `assets/src/{scss,js,images}/` sources → `assets/{css,js,images}/` output +
  `styles`(sass)/`scripts`(wp-scripts)/`images`/`build` npm scripts + `sass` devDep.
- [x] T003b Generated `functions.php` enqueues the compiled output via the CoreX asset helpers (no hardcoded paths);
  README stub documents it. (Replaced the old per-theme `inc/Assets.php` — the framework helpers are the one way.)
- [x] T003c Generator tests updated (Scaffolder/Starter/Validation): new files/scripts + helper usage asserted.

### T004 — Asset docs (FR-062-06, asset half)
- [x] T004a docs-app + handbook: `Corex\Assets\*` vs `Corex\Media\*`; SCSS source-only; helpers are the approved path.
- [x] T004b README / agent files / make:site stubs note the helper usage + the Assets/Media split.

### T005 — Validation + PR A
- [x] T005a composer validate, PHP lint, Pest, Jest, build, docs-app build, build:dist+verify, git diff --check.
- [x] T005b Open + merge PR A.

## PR C — WebP gate + reset CLI + media docs

- [x] T010 `WebpGate` (pure: present/valid + dimensions + saving≥threshold → active_for_delivery + inactive_reason)
  + `WebpMeta` per-derivative record (measured + persisted as `_corex_webp` attachment meta); wired into the upload
  + regenerate conversion and into delivery (`MediaImage` serves WebP only when active); `media.webp.min_saving`
  setting + `corex_media_min_saving` filter. Tests: WebpGate, WebpMeta round-trip.
- [x] T011 `wp corex media reset-webp [--dry-run] [--all] [--attachment] [--limit]` — tracked-only deletion (never
  originals/manual/untracked), clears meta, counts; `delete_attachment` removes only the tracked derivative. Tests:
  WebpResetCommand::target safety.
- [x] T013 Media-half docs (WebP gate, not-a-duplicate-attachment, reset/regenerate/delete) — media guide + README.

## PR D — Dist client-asset verification (FR-062-05)
- [x] T012 `verifyClientAssets` in `verify-shared-host-dist`: a theme shipping `assets/src/scss` (or
  `assets/src/js`) must also ship compiled `assets/css/*.css` (or `assets/js/*.js`) — so a deploy can't package a
  half-built client theme. Tests added; deploy docs note "build client theme assets before build:dist" (the Azure
  build stage is the place for it).

## Release
- [x] T020 v0.30.0 after PR A–D merge and the release gate passes.

## Release
- [ ] T020 v0.30.0 after PR A + PR B merge and the release gate passes.

## Priority 2 (started after the first-site foundation; not blockers)
- [x] Retrofit CoreX UI image blocks (Hero/Gallery/Team) to the `corex_media_optimize_image` seam — DONE:
  PictureRenderer preserves class+loading; `picture { display: contents }` keeps the wrapper layout-transparent.
- [~] M6 acceptance sweep — **automated RTL + 200%-zoom verified PASS** (no horizontal overflow on login + Add-ons;
  RTL mirrors correctly); full-keyboard + light-mode remain manual (recorded in spec 061 acceptance-evidence.md).
- [x] Arabic team-workflow docs mirror — regenerated (`docs/ar/**` placeholders, PR #75).
- [x] PR #60 Astro 7 — validated: **blocked upstream** (no Starlight release peers Astro 7); held with a PR handoff.
- [x] Curated WP Font Library collection — DONE: `Corex\Assets\FontCollection` registers the CoreX brand
  typefaces (Space Grotesk / JetBrains Mono / IBM Plex Sans Arabic — OFL, self-hosted) via
  `wp_register_font_collection` on `init`, so editors can install them from Appearance → Fonts. Pure definition +
  test; guarded for older runtimes; production path stays source-controlled client-theme fonts.
