# Feature Specification: Brand Tokens and Logo System

**Feature Branch**: `spec/057-brand-tokens-logo-system`

**Created**: 2026-06-19

**Status**: Clarified

**Input**: User description: "Approve the M2 brand foundation handoff and specify the CoreX brand tokens and logo
system without implementing the visual redesign."

## Goal

Establish one accessible, brandable CoreX logo and visual-token contract that aligns the product identity,
front-end blocks, FSE theme, and restrained admin product surfaces without creating a competing token source or
expanding into later design milestones.

## Problem Statement

CoreX already has substantial theme, block, admin, and design-system foundations, but the current visual values and
usage are not yet reconciled with the approved dark-first CoreX identity. Token consumers use a mixture of current
theme presets, custom properties, WordPress admin fallbacks, and historical naming. Typography does not yet express
the approved Latin display, technical, and Arabic roles, while the logo system and mode-specific usage rules are not
recorded as an implementable contract. Changing isolated values would create drift, duplicate sources, inaccessible
states, or a CoreX product identity that cannot be rebranded for client sites.

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-06-19

- Q: How should existing token slugs be reconciled? → A: Use compatibility-first retention: retain valid stable
  slugs, add missing semantic roles, alias legacy references, and deprecate a slug only after at least one minor
  release with zero remaining first-party consumers.
- Q: What is the authoritative production logo source? → A: Require an owner-approved vector package with recorded
  provenance; treat the existing navy/cyan SVG as a legacy migration reference, not as the new geometric Core X
  source artwork.
- Q: What is the minimum production font delivery contract? → A: Keep Latin body/interface text on the system
  stack and ship at most four self-hosted WOFF2 files: Space Grotesk variable 500–700 Latin, JetBrains Mono variable
  400–600 Latin, and IBM Plex Sans Arabic 400 and 600 Arabic subsets. Use `font-display: swap`; do not preload a
  font unless measured evidence justifies it.
- Q: How should CoreX admin screens map semantic roles when theme tokens are unavailable? → A: Define a small
  `--corex-admin-*` semantic adapter scoped to CoreX admin roots, map it to stable WordPress admin CSS variables where
  available, centralize documented WordPress palette fallbacks there, and never load the front-end theme token set
  into wp-admin.
- Q: How should `brand.json` preserve client override compatibility? → A: Preserve the current merge contract:
  associative maps merge recursively and lists replace wholesale. Require complete replacement arrays for palette
  and font presets, add validation and migration guidance, and cover existing override shapes with fixtures rather
  than silently changing list semantics.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Apply one coherent CoreX visual foundation (Priority: P1)

As a CoreX maintainer, I need one documented brand-token contract so product, theme, block, and admin surfaces use
the same visual roles and can be changed without hunting through component-specific values.

**Why this priority**: Every later design milestone depends on stable token names and mode behavior. Parallel or
ambiguous sources would multiply migration work across navigation, kits, components, forms, and documentation.

**Independent Test**: A reviewer can trace every approved token group to one canonical runtime source and identify
how theme, block, and admin consumers obtain the corresponding semantic role.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** existing token definitions and consumers, **When** the token contract is reviewed, **Then** every
   retained, added, aliased, migrated, or deprecated name has one documented purpose and owner.
2. **Given** a component needs a brand value, **When** its styling is reviewed, **Then** it consumes the canonical
   semantic token or documented admin fallback instead of introducing a component-local value.
3. **Given** a client overrides CoreX defaults, **When** the approved override mechanism is used, **Then** the site
   can express its own brand without changing component code or inheriting unnecessary CoreX product branding.

---

### User Story 2 - Use CoreX accessibly in dark, light, LTR, and RTL contexts (Priority: P1)

As a site visitor or administrator, I need readable typography, visible interaction states, and correct direction
behavior in both supported color modes so the interface remains usable regardless of language or mode.

**Why this priority**: Accessibility, Arabic, RTL, and light-mode support are baseline Free/Core requirements, not
later polish or commercial features.

**Independent Test**: Representative content and interactive states can be evaluated in dark/light and LTR/RTL
combinations without missing semantic roles, invisible focus, clipped text, or physical-direction assumptions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** dark or light mode, **When** representative text, controls, borders, statuses, overlays, and focus rings
   are inspected, **Then** each state has a documented semantic mapping and meets the accessibility baseline.
2. **Given** Arabic or mixed Arabic/Latin content, **When** headings, body text, code, labels, numbers, and long
   strings render, **Then** the documented font and direction strategy preserves shaping, order, and readability.
3. **Given** keyboard navigation, **When** focus moves across supported surfaces, **Then** the focus indicator remains
   visible and is not communicated by color alone.

---

### User Story 3 - Present the CoreX mark consistently (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer producing CoreX product and documentation surfaces, I need a reusable geometric Core X logo system
so the mark is recognizable, legible, and used consistently without embedding it into client-site identity.

**Why this priority**: A coherent logo system completes the product foundation, but it must remain separate from
the client-brand override contract.

**Independent Test**: A reviewer can select the correct symbol, wordmark, lockup, or monochrome variant for a
supported background and size using documented rules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an approved CoreX-owned surface, **When** a logo is selected, **Then** its variant, minimum size,
   clear space, contrast treatment, and accessible-name behavior follow the documented usage rules.
2. **Given** a client website, **When** its brand is configured, **Then** the CoreX product mark is not forced into
   the public site identity.
3. **Given** dark and light surfaces, **When** the logo renders, **Then** an appropriate vector variant remains
   legible without a separate raster asset for each viewport or density.

---

### User Story 4 - Preserve existing surfaces during token migration (Priority: P2)

As an engineer, I need a bounded migration and compatibility contract so token alignment does not silently break
existing blocks, style variations, admin screens, or brand overrides.

**Why this priority**: Existing consumers use historical slugs and admin fallbacks. A visual replacement without an
inventory and compatibility path would create regressions that ordinary unit tests may not expose.

**Independent Test**: The implementation plan can map current consumers, define compatibility handling, and verify
representative existing surfaces before removing or changing any historical token name.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing token consumer, **When** its token is changed or deprecated, **Then** a documented migration
   or compatibility path prevents an undefined custom property.
2. **Given** an admin surface where theme tokens are unavailable, **When** it renders, **Then** a documented semantic
   fallback remains usable and consistent with WordPress admin conventions.
3. **Given** a current per-site override, **When** the canonical token contract changes, **Then** compatibility and
   rollback behavior are documented before implementation.

### Edge Cases

- A user selects a mode or client palette whose accent fails against one or more surfaces.
- Arabic headings contain Latin product names, code, numerals, or punctuation.
- A font asset fails to load or a requested script/weight is unavailable.
- A logo appears at a very small size, on a photographic background, or inside a constrained square icon slot.
- A historical block references a token slug absent from the current theme definition.
- Theme tokens are unavailable in wp-admin and the WordPress fallback palette is active.
- High-contrast or forced-colors modes override authored colors and shadows.
- A client override replaces a palette list rather than merging individual semantic entries.
- A client supplies an incomplete palette or font-preset list and would remove required semantic entries under the
  documented wholesale-list replacement contract.
- Dark/light switching occurs without client-side JavaScript or before optional assets load.
- A future edition badge needs neutral naming without introducing entitlement behavior.

## Scope

- CoreX logo system integration: geometric Core X symbol, wordmark, lockup, monochrome/contrast variants, usage
  rules, accessible naming, and separation from client-site branding.
- Brand token definitions and naming rules.
- Typography roles for Space Grotesk, JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Sans Arabic, body/system fallbacks, weights,
  line-height, letter spacing, and fluid type scale.
- Semantic color roles for dark-first and complete light behavior, including surfaces, text hierarchy, borders,
  links, interactive states, statuses, overlays, and selection.
- Spacing, radius, shadow/elevation, border, and focus-ring token groups.
- Dark/light mode selection and semantic parity.
- RTL typography, mixed-script, bidirectional isolation, and logical-direction behavior.
- Alignment between the canonical theme token source, WordPress-generated custom properties, style variations,
  per-site overrides, admin product fallbacks, and block/front-end consumers.
- Restrained admin/product visual-base alignment without redesigning screens or workflows.
- Documentation updates for token ownership, logo usage, modes, typography, overrides, accessibility, and migration.
- Version/readiness documentation only when implementation changes a release surface or readiness evidence.

## Out of Scope

- Full admin dashboard redesign.
- Header, mobile navigation, mega-menu, footer, or template-part patterns.
- Company Kit page expansion.
- Blocks or components expansion beyond token alignment.
- Forms redesign.
- Documentation-site visual redesign.
- Marketing landing-page rebuild.
- Pro licensing, entitlement, distribution, or commercial UI.
- Front-office editor workspace.
- Heavy animation or a new motion system.
- Specs 058 or 059 and any implementation belonging to them.

## Design Dependency

Implementation depends on the approved [M2 Brand Foundation Handoff](../../design/handoffs/brand-foundation.md).
The handoff approves the identity, typography, mode, accessibility, RTL, brandability, and scope direction. Planning
must still inventory current token consumers and confirm the production vector assets and minimum font files/weights
before implementation tasks are finalized. A later visual exploration may refine values only by updating the handoff
and this spec before code changes.

The existing bundled navy/cyan SVG is historical implementation evidence only. Logo implementation remains blocked
until the owner supplies or explicitly approves a production vector package and its provenance is recorded in the
handoff or implementation plan.

## Likely Affected Areas

- FSE theme token definitions, style variations, and global element styles.
- Per-site brand override documentation and compatibility behavior.
- CoreX-owned logo assets and product-brand usage documentation.
- Front-end and editor block styles that consume current token names.
- Admin product styles that currently use theme-token references with WordPress palette fallbacks.
- Design-system and branding documentation.
- Token, metadata, build, accessibility, RTL, and visual-regression checks.
- Release/readiness documentation if the implementation changes versioned behavior.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST retain one canonical runtime design-token source and MUST NOT add a parallel token
  registry, component-local palette, CSS framework variable layer, or build-time token authority.
- **FR-002**: The token inventory MUST record each definition source, generated custom-property name, consumer,
  dark/light mapping, admin/client context, classification, replacement or alias, and compatibility impact. Every
  existing and proposed token MUST be classified as retained, added, aliased, migrated, or deprecated before
  consumers are changed. Valid stable slugs MUST be retained; missing semantic roles MAY be added; legacy references
  MUST receive compatibility aliases before migration; and a slug MUST NOT be removed until it has been deprecated
  for at least one minor release and has zero first-party consumers.
- **FR-003**: Token names MUST describe stable semantic roles or reusable scales rather than a single component,
  page, product edition, or transient campaign.
- **FR-004**: The color contract MUST define semantic parity for dark and light modes across surfaces, text,
  borders, links, controls, statuses, overlays, selection, and focus.
- **FR-005**: The typography contract MUST keep Latin body/interface text on the system stack and define
  display/heading, code/technical, and Arabic roles with explicit fallbacks. Production delivery MUST be limited to
  at most four self-hosted WOFF2 files: Space Grotesk variable 500–700 Latin, JetBrains Mono variable 400–600 Latin,
  and IBM Plex Sans Arabic 400 and 600 Arabic subsets.
- **FR-006**: Arabic content MUST use IBM Plex Sans Arabic in the approved roles while mixed-script content and
  technical fragments retain readable bidirectional order.
- **FR-007**: The spacing, radius, shadow/elevation, border, and focus-ring scales MUST each have documented names,
  purposes, and supported usage boundaries.
- **FR-008**: Focus-ring tokens MUST produce a visible indicator across every supported surface and mode and MUST
  not depend on color as the sole indication of focus.
- **FR-009**: The CoreX logo system MUST define symbol, wordmark, lockup, and monochrome/contrast variants from an
  owner-approved production vector package with recorded source, approval, and usage provenance, plus minimum-size,
  clear-space, background, and accessible-name rules.
- **FR-010**: CoreX product logo assets MUST be reusable vectors and MUST NOT be imposed on client-site identity.
  The existing navy/cyan SVG MUST be treated as a legacy migration reference and MUST NOT be presented as the new
  geometric Core X source artwork without separate owner approval.
- **FR-011**: Theme tokens, generated CSS custom properties, style variations, and per-site overrides MUST use a
  documented mapping with no undefined or competing names.
- **FR-012**: Existing block/front-end consumers MUST be inventoried and aligned without expanding their features
  or redesigning their layouts.
- **FR-013**: Existing admin product consumers MUST map through a small `--corex-admin-*` semantic adapter scoped to
  CoreX admin roots. The adapter MUST use stable WordPress admin CSS variables where available, MUST centralize
  documented WordPress palette fallbacks, and MUST NOT load the front-end theme token set into wp-admin or become a
  second client-brand authority.
- **FR-014**: The implementation MUST preserve logical-property and RTL-first styling and MUST NOT add physical
  direction assumptions.
- **FR-015**: Client branding MUST remain configurable through the existing runtime override mechanism without a
  recompile or component-code change. Its current merge contract MUST remain stable: associative maps merge
  recursively and lists replace wholesale. Palette and font-preset overrides MUST therefore provide complete
  replacement arrays, and validation MUST reject or clearly report arrays that omit required semantic entries.
- **FR-016**: Future edition/status token names MAY be neutral and extensible, but this feature MUST NOT implement
  Pro entitlement, licensing, gating, or commercial interface behavior.
- **FR-017**: Brand and design-system documentation MUST identify token ownership, consumption, overrides, modes,
  typography, logo usage, accessibility, and migration behavior.
- **FR-018**: Implementation MUST preserve existing behavior until compatibility and rollback tests cover any
  renamed or removed token.
- **FR-019**: This specification-creation task MUST NOT change product/design implementation code, runtime behavior,
  logo assets, font assets, release metadata, or component styling.

## Implementation Notes

- Start implementation planning with a machine-readable inventory of current theme definitions and all CSS/custom-
  property consumers. Record definition source, generated name, consumers, mode/admin/client context,
  classification, replacement/alias, and compatibility impact. Do not begin by replacing palette values.
- Retain stable WordPress preset slugs and map them to approved semantics. Add a slug only when the inventory proves
  the current contract cannot express the required role. Treat currently referenced but undefined legacy names as
  alias-and-migrate work, not as permission to normalize every consumer in one breaking change.
- Keep `theme.json` authoritative. Style variations express mode mappings; per-site `brand.json` remains the runtime
  override seam.
- Preserve `BrandResolver` merge semantics. Treat palette and font-preset lists as complete replacements, add
  validation for required semantic entries, and update migration guidance and examples so they do not imply
  merge-by-slug behavior.
- Treat admin styles as a deliberate, scoped adapter: define the minimum `--corex-admin-*` semantic roles once on
  CoreX admin roots, derive them from stable WordPress admin variables where available, and keep literal fallback
  values only in that adapter. Admin components consume the adapter rather than repeating fallback chains. Do not
  inject the full front-end theme into wp-admin.
- Keep logo assets presentation-only and separate from framework/business logic. Do not redraw, trace, or promote
  the existing SVG as production artwork; planning must reference the owner-approved source package and provenance.
- Use only self-hosted, provenance-recorded WOFF2 font assets. Keep Latin body/interface text on the system stack;
  use the approved variable Latin ranges and two Arabic static weights. If an authoritative upstream package cannot
  provide a specified variable/subset file, planning must document an equal-or-smaller fallback package without
  exceeding four files or broadening the weight ranges.
- Use logical properties and semantic mode roles so later M3/M4 work consumes the system without reopening it.

## Accessibility Requirements

- Meet WCAG 2.2 AA contrast for normal text, large text, meaningful non-text graphics, controls, focus indicators,
  and interaction states in both modes.
- Verify focus visibility against every supported surface, including error/status surfaces and overlays.
- Do not communicate state or edition by color alone.
- Support keyboard use, forced-colors/high-contrast behavior, zoom, text resizing, content expansion, and visible
  selection states.
- Provide documented accessible-name and decorative-image handling for each logo usage category.
- Record contrast evidence and any constrained token pairings rather than claiming that every arbitrary client
  override is automatically accessible.
- Maintain an evidence matrix for every supported semantic foreground/background, control, status, border, and
  focus pairing in dark and light modes. Automated checks MUST enforce at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for
  large text and meaningful non-text UI/focus boundaries; manual review MUST cover forced-colors, imagery, gradients,
  and state recognition beyond color.

## RTL Requirements

- Use logical properties and direction-aware alignment by default.
- Define Arabic font roles, fallbacks, weights, line height, and shaping expectations.
- Verify mixed Arabic/Latin headings, code, commands, numerals, punctuation, badges, and product names.
- Use bidirectional isolation where embedded technical fragments could reorder surrounding text.
- Do not create mirrored logo artwork unless the approved mark specifically requires directional meaning; document
  the logo as non-directional by default.
- Use a repeatable fixture matrix covering Arabic-only, English-only, mixed product names, code/commands, Arabic and
  Western numerals, punctuation, badges, long translations, and nested direction changes in both modes. Verify
  shaping/order, keyboard focus order, logical alignment, clipping, and horizontal overflow at default and 200% zoom.

## Mobile/Responsive Requirements

- Preserve bounded fluid type scales and readable line lengths from narrow mobile screens to wide layouts.
- Verify text zoom, long translations, Arabic content expansion, and compact technical labels without clipping or
  horizontal scrolling.
- Provide compact and full logo lockup guidance based on available space, not separate raster assets per breakpoint.
- Token alignment MUST NOT introduce new page layouts, breakpoint systems, or component behavior in this feature.

## Performance Requirements

- Font delivery MUST be self-hosted, subset by approved scripts, WOFF2-only, and limited to the four-file maximum
  and approved weight ranges.
- Font loading MUST use `font-display: swap`, retain readable fallback text, and avoid invisible-text blocking.
  Fonts MUST NOT be preloaded by default; a preload requires measured evidence that it improves the target surface
  without causing unused-preload warnings or delaying more important resources.
- Logo delivery MUST use optimized reusable vectors without global JavaScript.
- Token alignment MUST not add a CSS framework, icon font, client-side theming framework, or unconditional asset
  bundle.
- Existing conditional block-asset loading behavior MUST remain intact.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Existing required tests and builds remain passing after implementation.
- [ ] Token names are internally consistent, documented, and mapped to one canonical source.
- [ ] No duplicate or competing token source is introduced.
- [ ] `theme.json`, WordPress-generated CSS custom properties, style variations, per-site overrides, admin fallbacks,
      and existing CSS consumers are aligned where applicable.
- [ ] Dark and light behavior is documented for every semantic color role and representative state.
- [ ] The RTL font and mixed-script strategy is documented and verified with representative content.
- [ ] The accessibility baseline includes recorded contrast and focus-visibility checks for both modes.
- [ ] A dark/light semantic-pair evidence matrix passes the documented 4.5:1 text and 3:1 large-text/non-text
      thresholds, with forced-colors, imagery/gradient, and non-color state evidence reviewed manually.
- [ ] The logo system documents supported variants, spacing, size, contrast, client-brand separation, and accessible
      naming.
- [ ] Existing block and admin surfaces receive token alignment only; no feature or layout redesign is included.
- [ ] CoreX admin styles consume one scoped `--corex-admin-*` adapter; WordPress palette fallbacks are centralized,
      and front-end theme tokens are not loaded into wp-admin.
- [ ] Font assets and the owner-approved production logo package have documented provenance, bounded delivery
      requirements, and fallbacks before shipping.
- [ ] Production typography uses no more than four self-hosted WOFF2 files, keeps Latin body/interface text on the
      system stack, uses `font-display: swap`, and has no unmeasured preload.
- [ ] Documentation explains token ownership, consumption, override, compatibility, and rollback behavior.
- [ ] `brand.json` keeps recursive associative-map merging and wholesale list replacement; complete palette/font
      arrays, invalid-array reporting, compatibility fixtures, and migration guidance are verified.
- [ ] No product/design code, assets, styling, or runtime behavior is implemented in this spec-creation task.

## Tests/Checks Required

- Parse and schema-validate all changed token and style-variation data.
- Add or update token-contract tests covering required groups, unique slugs, semantic mappings, and absence of
  undefined references.
- Scan block, theme, and admin styles for raw values and unknown/retired custom-property names, with documented
  allowances only for the centralized WordPress admin adapter and functional layout constants.
- Verify the admin adapter is scoped to CoreX screens, maps every required semantic role, contains all documented
  WordPress palette fallbacks, and does not leak into unrelated wp-admin screens.
- Verify per-site override merge behavior with fixtures for associative-map merging, complete palette/font list
  replacement, incomplete-list rejection/reporting, retained/migrated token names, and representative existing
  override shapes.
- Run existing PHP, JavaScript, build, metadata, and documentation checks.
- Generate and test the complete supported semantic-pair matrix in dark/light modes: at least 4.5:1 for normal text
  and 3:1 for large text and meaningful non-text UI/focus boundaries. Manually review forced-colors, imagery,
  gradients, focus visibility, and state recognition beyond color.
- Verify the repeatable LTR/RTL fixture matrix for Arabic-only, English-only, mixed product names, code/commands,
  Arabic and Western numerals, punctuation, badges, long translations, and nested direction changes. Check shaping,
  order, keyboard focus order, logical alignment, clipping, and horizontal overflow at default and 200% zoom.
- Verify fallback rendering, family/weight/script coverage, WOFF2 delivery, the four-file maximum,
  `font-display: swap`, and the absence of unmeasured or unused preloads.
- Verify the logo package approval/provenance record, SVG structure, accessible-name usage, contrast variants, and
  rendering at documented minimum sizes; verify the legacy SVG is not silently promoted as new source artwork.
- Run visual regression or browser checks where the environment supports them; mark unavailable browser evidence as
  environment-gated rather than passing.
- Run `git diff --check` and the applicable documentation, clean-code, WordPress, and test guards before delivery.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of token definitions and discovered consumers are classified and mapped to one documented
  canonical contract before implementation is accepted.
- **SC-002**: Zero duplicate token authorities or undefined token references remain in the verified implementation.
- **SC-003**: All representative dark/light and LTR/RTL accessibility checks meet the documented WCAG 2.2 AA
  baseline or produce an explicit blocking finding.
- **SC-004**: The approved typography roles render representative Latin, Arabic, mixed-script, and technical content
  without clipping, invisible text, or direction-order defects at supported responsive sizes.
- **SC-005**: Every supported logo usage can be selected from documented vector variants without creating a new
  raster asset for a viewport, density, or mode.
- **SC-006**: Existing required test suites and builds retain their pre-implementation pass status.
- **SC-007**: The specification-creation change contains zero product, runtime, style, font, or logo-asset changes.

## Risks

- Renaming established slugs can break blocks, style variations, and client overrides outside obvious theme files.
- Dark-first values can produce incomplete or low-contrast light mappings if roles are treated as direct inversions.
- Loading three font families without strict weights/subsets can harm rendering performance.
- Arabic may inherit Latin display assumptions that harm shaping, rhythm, or mixed-script readability.
- Bringing front-end tokens directly into wp-admin can fight WordPress conventions or increase CSS scope.
- Logo work can accidentally become a marketing redesign or leak CoreX identity into client sites.
- Automated contrast checks can miss gradients, imagery, forced-colors behavior, and non-text focus visibility.

## Rollback Notes

- Keep the implementation isolated so the token/logo alignment can be reverted without reverting unrelated product
  behavior or data.
- Preserve a documented mapping of previous token names and values until all consumers and overrides are verified.
- If a renamed token causes regressions, restore the previous name or compatibility alias first; do not patch each
  component with local values.
- Keep every deprecation alias through at least one minor release and remove it only after repository scans prove
  that no first-party consumer remains.
- Preserve `BrandResolver` list-replacement behavior during rollback. Restore the previous complete palette/font
  arrays and aliases as one unit; do not introduce merge-by-slug behavior as an emergency patch.
- Font and logo assets must be removable without breaking content, administration, or runtime boot.
- No database migration is expected; if planning later discovers one, update and re-review this spec before work.

## Assumptions

- The approved M2 handoff is the product owner's design approval for this engineering-spec stage.
- The existing theme token source and runtime brand override mechanism remain architectural constraints.
- Exact production token values and font files will be finalized during planning from the approved direction and
  current-consumer inventory. Production logo vectors must come from an owner-approved package with provenance;
  they are not invented during clarification or planning.
- Accessibility, RTL, internationalization, and client brandability remain Free/Core capabilities.
