# Specification Quality Checklist: Data Layer — Model, Field Driver, Repository, QueryBuilder

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Framework-infrastructure feature, so "users" are Corex module developers; user stories are developer
  journeys (consistent with spec 001's framing).
- ACF is named because it is the *subject* of a constitutional requirement (Principle IX: optional
  plugins behind a driver) — it constrains behavior, not implementation choice. WP_Query/`$wpdb`/meta
  appear only in the Input echo and Assumptions as the data-source context, not as prescribed APIs.
- Resolved in the 2026-06-08 `/speckit-clarify` session (see spec Clarifications): entity sources =
  posts only (v1); Models = strictly read-only value objects (writes via Repository); field driver =
  ACF API when present / native meta when absent (FR-009); eager loading = belongs-to relation (v1,
  FR-018); query cap = 500, configurable via `query.max` (FR-015). No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
