# Corex — Agent Entry Point (Codex, Cursor, Gemini, any LLM)

You are working on **Corex**, a professional, Laravel-inspired WordPress framework.
Namespace `Corex\`, CLI `wp corex`, CSS prefix `--corex-`. Target: WordPress 7.0+,
PHP 8.3+, FSE block themes. Built spec-first with Spec Kit. This file mirrors `CLAUDE.md`.

## Cold-start sequence (docs/internal/COREX-WORKING-GUIDE.md Part E)
A fresh agent, given only this repo, must be able to read four files and correctly
state what to build next — without anyone explaining. Do this, in order:
1. Read `specs/constitution.md` — the non-negotiable rules. They override everything.
   (Canonical source: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`; `specs/constitution.md` mirrors it.)
2. Read `PROGRESS.md` — current status; continue from the "Next" section.
3. Read the active spec in `specs/` for the module you're touching.
4. Skim `docs/internal/COREX-FRAMEWORK.md` (architecture) and `docs/internal/COREX-WORKING-GUIDE.md` (how we work).
   `docs/internal/COREX-EMAIL-ADDON.md` is the Corex Mail spec for when its turn comes.

## Source-of-truth hierarchy (top wins) — §A.1
1. `specs/constitution.md`  2. `docs/internal/COREX-FRAMEWORK.md`  3. the active module spec
4. `PROGRESS.md`  5. the code. If code contradicts the constitution, the code is wrong.

## Precedence between the instruction files themselves

Stated here once, and referenced rather than restated by the others. Four files tell an agent how to
work, and until spec 098 each of them carried its own partial copy of the workflow — which is three
chances for the copies to disagree and no way to tell which one was right.

1. **`specs/constitution.md`** (→ `.specify/memory/constitution.md`) — the non-negotiable rules.
   Overrides everything below, including a direct request. Where they conflict, say so rather than
   comply.
2. **`AGENTS.md`** — this file. The precedence order, the cold-start sequence, the Role Gate, and the
   required handoff format. `CLAUDE.md` is its Claude Code-flavoured mirror and must not diverge on
   anything but tooling.
3. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — the mechanics: branching, commit messages, versioning, how to run each
   suite, and what the guard gate runs. Where this file names a rule and `CONTRIBUTING.md` gives the
   command for it, `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the one to follow.
4. **`SECURITY.md`** — reporting, supported versions, and the dependency-advisory policy. Authoritative
   on its own subject over anything above it.

`README.md` carries the table of which *root document* answers which question. That is a different
question from this one, and neither list repeats the other.

## Role Gate — classify the session BEFORE editing (spec 061)
> Role Gate decides **where** you work · Model Routing Gate decides **capability and provider adapter** · Spec Kit decides **what** to build · Guard Gate decides **whether**
> it is safe to ship · UI/UX ProMax decides **whether** visible UI is good enough.

## Model Routing Gate — classify capability BEFORE broad exploration or editing (spec 069)

After the Role Gate and before Spec Kit, classify L (read-only exploration), M (routine), H (complex/high-risk sole writer), or V (critical read-only verification) using [the shared policy](docs/en/04-team-workflow/model-routing.md). Declare:

`MODEL ROUTE — <provider> · <L|M|H|V> · <parent-or-agent> · <configured model/effort> · <reason>`

Declare evidence-based changes with `MODEL ROUTE CHANGE — <old> → <new> · <specific trigger>`. Use the lowest reliable route; do not claim the parent model changed, report whether a child was actually spawned, and distinguish configured from runtime-confirmed values. Never run Codex and Claude as simultaneous writers, never assign duplicate work, keep one production writer, and keep delegation at one level. Route H is the sole writer; Route V is read-only. See the shared policy for escalation, overrides, handoff, and rollback.

Pick exactly one mode and stay inside it (full detail: docs/internal/COREX-WORKING-GUIDE.md §F; prompts:
`docs/en/04-team-workflow/ai-agent-start-prompts.md`):

1. **CoreX Framework Mode** — edits `plugins/`, `addons/`, `packages/`, root `theme/`, root `specs/`, root `docs/`,
   `docs-app/`, `ROADMAP.md`, root `PROGRESS.md`, CoreX admin/login/docs UI, release/versioning. Follow the root
   agent files + `specs/constitution.md` + `docs/internal/COREX-WORKING-GUIDE.md` + `docs/internal/COREX-FRAMEWORK.md`. **Must not** edit
   `sites/<client>/` unless explicitly authorized.
2. **Client Site Mode** — edits `sites/<client>/` only (client plugin/theme, pages, blocks, templates, content,
   branding). Follow the root files for global safety + `sites/<client>/{AGENTS,CLAUDE,PROGRESS,DECISIONS}.md` +
   `sites/<client>/specs/`. **Must not** continue the CoreX roadmap or edit `plugins/`, `addons/`, `packages/`,
   root `theme/`, root `specs/`, `ROADMAP.md`, or root `PROGRESS.md` unless explicitly authorized.
3. **Deployment Mode** — edits the `dist` builder, `azure-pipelines.yml`, deploy scripts, release artifacts,
   runtime-file protection, rollback. **Must not** make client-design or framework-product changes beyond packaging.
4. **Docs/Planning Mode** — edits docs, specs, roadmap, decisions, prompts, handoffs. **Must not** ship runtime code
   unless explicitly authorized.

Never edit as source: `wp/wp-content/` and `dist/` (runtime/build output). `dist/` is generated and git-ignored.

## Required response/handoff format (spec 061)
End every working response with:
```text
SUMMARY            - What was done.
WORKSPACE          - Branch: / Repo root: / Git status: / Files changed:
MODE               - Framework / Client Site / Deployment / Docs-Planning
SPEC KIT STATUS    - Spec path: / Task IDs: / Completed: / Remaining:
VERIFICATION       - Commands run: / Results: / Guards run:
BLOCKERS / DECISIONS NEEDED
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP
---
NEXT STEP
- Just completed: / Recommended next: / Why: / Alternatives: / Blockers/decisions needed from you:
---
```

## WHILE working
- Run `git status --short --branch` before edits; work from the active feature branch, never from `main`.
- **Single workspace (docs/internal/COREX-WORKING-GUIDE.md §A.7):** work only from the normal project root checkout — no
  `.worktrees` without explicit owner approval. Before editing, verify root/branch/status/log/remote/worktree, and
  **stop and report** if you are on the wrong branch, in the wrong checkout, or see uncommitted changes you did not
  create. The active PR branch is the working source of truth — continue from its latest pushed commit; never
  recreate completed work. Push only to that branch while its PR is open.
- Claim branch, spec path, task IDs, and owned files before changing code. Do not edit files owned by another
  active agent unless the handoff explicitly transfers them.
- Follow the constitution exactly. If a request conflicts with it, say so rather than comply.
- Use the `wp corex make:*` generators (once built) rather than hand-writing boilerplate.
- Thin controllers, fat services, repositories own data access. Everything injected via the
  PSR-11 container — never instantiate a dependency inside a method.
- All styling via `theme.json` CSS variables. No hardcoded values. No CSS frameworks.
- Logical CSS properties (RTL-first). No optional plugin (ACF/Woo/Polylang) as a hard dependency.

## AFTER producing any code (Definition of Done — §D.4)
- **Guard Gate:** run the relevant guard skill on the diff BEFORE presenting it. Auto-install
  if missing. No diff ships until its guard runs clean.
  clean-code-guard (any prod code) · wp-guard (WP code) · woo-guard (Woo) · test-guard · docs-guard.
- Tests written (Pest / Jest / Playwright), i18n-ready, RTL-verified, WCAG 2.2 AA for UI.
- Update `PROGRESS.md`; log non-trivial decisions in `DECISIONS.md`.
- For multi-agent work, final reports and handoffs must name the branch, spec path, completed task IDs,
  files owned, verification commands/results, guard status, and any files being released for another agent.
- **End every response with a NEXT STEP block** (format in docs/internal/COREX-WORKING-GUIDE.md §A.3 / constitution).

## Spec Kit workflow (commands namespaced `speckit-*`)
`/speckit-constitution` → `/speckit-specify` → `/speckit-clarify` → `/speckit-plan`
→ `/speckit-tasks` → `/speckit-implement`. Spec before code; review between tasks.
Module build order: see `docs/internal/COREX-SPECKIT-START.md` ("The rhythm from here").

Durable memory lives in files (`PROGRESS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `specs/`), not chat.
Nothing here is Claude-only — this workflow is model-agnostic by design.
