# Branching, commits & pull requests

The git model Corex uses, with the exact commands. The rules come from
[`COREX-FRAMEWORK.md §19`](../../../COREX-FRAMEWORK.md) and [`COREX-WORKING-GUIDE.md`](../../../COREX-WORKING-GUIDE.md).

## The branching model (git-flow-lite)

```mermaid
gitGraph
  commit id: "main (tagged releases)"
  branch develop
  commit id: "develop (integration)"
  branch feature/NNN-x
  commit id: "work"
  commit id: "work"
  checkout develop
  merge feature/NNN-x id: "PR merge"
  checkout main
  merge develop id: "Release vX.Y.0" tag: "vX.Y.0"
```

- **`main`** — production-ready, **tagged releases only**. Environments deploy a tag, never a branch.
- **`develop`** — the integration branch; features merge here first.
- **`feature/NNN-name`** — short-lived, branched off `develop`, one per spec/feature.

Start a feature:

```bash
git checkout develop && git pull
git checkout -b feature/029-my-thing develop
```

```text
Switched to a new branch 'feature/029-my-thing'
```

## Multi-agent ownership

Before editing, run:

```bash
git status --short --branch
```

Active work happens on a `feature/NNN-name` branch, never on `main`. When multiple agents or humans are active,
each work unit must claim its branch, spec path, task IDs, and files owned before making changes. Do not edit a
file claimed by another active work unit unless the handoff explicitly transfers ownership.

Completed handoffs and PR summaries include:

```text
Branch: feature/055-stable-client-readiness
Spec: specs/055-stable-client-readiness
Tasks: T021, T022
Files owned: packages/cli/src/Release/AgentWorkUnit.php, tests/Unit/Release/AgentWorkUnitTest.php
Verification: vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/Release/AgentWorkUnitTest.php
Guards: test-guard clean
Released files: tests/Unit/Release/AgentWorkUnitTest.php
```

## Commits — Conventional Commits

Every commit message follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): a `type(scope):`
prefix and an imperative summary.

```bash
git commit -m "feat(forms): add a date field type"
```

```text
[feature/029-my-thing abc1234] feat(forms): add a date field type
```

Common types used in this repo: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `chore`. The scope is the
module (`core`, `forms`, `blocks`, `config`, `ui`, `cli`, …). End AI-assisted commits with the
`Co-Authored-By:` trailer the project uses.

## Pull requests

1. Push your branch and open a PR **into `develop`**:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/029-my-thing
   gh pr create --base develop --title "feat(forms): date field type" --body "..."
   ```

   ```text
   https://github.com/MustafaShaaban/corex/pull/30
   ```

2. **CI must be green** — the [quality gates](./quality-gates.md) run automatically
   ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/ci.yml)).
3. **Review**: the PR describes what changed and why; it links its spec; it shows tests passing. A reviewer
   checks it against the constitution (architecture, tokens, security, i18n/RTL) and the Definition of Done.
4. **Merge** into `develop` once approved + green. Releases are cut by merging `develop` → `main` and tagging
   `vX.Y.0` (with a `CHANGELOG.md` entry).

## Releasing (maintainers)

```bash
git checkout main && git merge --no-ff develop -m "Release v0.20.0 — ..."
git tag -a v0.20.0 -m "Corex v0.20.0" && git push origin main v0.20.0
```

```text
 * [new tag]  v0.20.0 -> v0.20.0
```
