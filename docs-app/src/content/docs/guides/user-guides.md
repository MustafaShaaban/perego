description: Ship in-admin user guides with your site, using the same registry Corex uses for its own.
---

Corex Guides puts a **Guides** screen in the admin and a Help tab on the screens your guides
describe. Corex registers its own guides through it — reading and answering messages, publishing a
post, checking whether an email was sent — and your site registers its own through exactly the same
public API.

This matters because a client's guide is about the client's site. It documents their post types and
their flows, it ships with their plugin, and it must survive a Corex upgrade without anybody editing
Corex.

## Scaffold one

```bash
wp corex make:guide Projects
```

That writes `Guides/ProjectsGuide.php` in your plugin, with a topic, two steps, and a warning — the
parts authors skip when starting from an empty file.

## Register it

From your service provider's `boot()`:

```php
use Corex\Guides\GuideRegistry;
use Corex\Support\Facades\Corex;

Corex::onReady( static function (): void {
    Corex::make( GuideRegistry::class )->registerDeferred(
        static fn (): array => [ ( new ProjectsGuide() )->guide() ]
    );
} );
```

:::danger[Wrap it in `Corex::onReady()`]
Calling `Corex::make()` directly from `plugins_loaded` is a coin flip that ends in a **white screen
on the whole site**. Corex boots on `plugins_loaded` at priority 10, and the generated site starter
boots there too — which one WordPress runs first depends on your plugin's *directory name*. The
plugin that loses reaches `Boot::app()`, which **throws**.

Nor can you guard it yourself: `Boot::app()` throws rather than returning null, so
`if ( Boot::app() === null )` — the check you would naturally write — *is* the crash. Use
`Corex::onReady()`, which runs immediately if Corex is up and waits for the `corex_booted` action if
it is not. There is no ordering left to get wrong.
:::

### Use `registerDeferred()`, not `register()`

Both exist, and only one is safe from a plugin.

Corex boots on `plugins_loaded` at priority 10. Your plugin very likely boots on `plugins_loaded` at
priority 10 too — the generated starter does. Which of you WordPress loads first depends on your
plugin's directory name, so `register()` works or silently does nothing depending on what you called
your folder.

`registerDeferred()` takes a factory and runs it the first time anything **reads** the registry,
which is an admin request — long after every plugin has loaded. There is no race left to lose.

:::caution[Keep the factory cheap]
It runs on **every admin page load**, not just on the Guides screen — Corex reads the registry on
`current_screen` to work out whether the page has a help tab. Building `Guide` objects costs
nothing, so that is free. A factory that queries the database or reads a file would put that cost on
every page in wp-admin. If your guide content really has to come from storage, cache it yourself:
the registry does not, because it cannot know how long your data stays fresh.
:::

## Write the guide

```php
use Corex\Guides\Guide;
use Corex\Guides\GuideStep;
use Corex\Guides\GuideTopic;

Guide::for( 'projects', __( 'Managing projects', 'perego' ) )
    ->withSummary( __( 'Add a project, choose where it appears, and publish it.', 'perego' ) )
    ->inSection( 'content' )
    ->onScreen( 'edit.php?post_type=perego_project' )
    ->requiring( 'edit_posts' )
    ->withTopic( GuideTopic::for(
        'add',
        __( 'Add a project', 'perego' ),
        '',
        [
            new GuideStep(
                __( 'Choose Projects, then Add Project.', 'perego' ),
                __( 'The editor opens with an empty project.', 'perego' ),
            ),
            new GuideStep(
                __( 'Choose Publish.', 'perego' ),
                __( 'The project appears on the Projects page.', 'perego' ),
                warning: __( 'Publishing makes it public immediately.', 'perego' ),
            ),
        ],
    ) );
```

### What each part does

| Method | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `inSection()` | Groups the guide on the Guides screen. Sections appear in **key order**, alphabetically — that is the only lever you have over where your section lands. |
| `onScreen()` | The admin address the guide describes. Also puts the guide in that screen's **Help tab**. Use the address WordPress itself uses: `edit.php` for posts, `edit.php?post_type=…` for anything else. |
| `requiring()` | The capability a reader needs. Anyone without it never sees the guide — they could not follow it. Omit it and the guide is shown to anyone who can open the admin. |
| `ordered()` | Position within the section. Lower first; the default is 50. |

### Steps

A step is an **instruction** and an **expected result**, not a paragraph. The pair is what makes a
step checkable: somebody does the first and can tell from the second whether it worked. A guide
written as prose reads fine and leaves people stuck with no way to know they are stuck.

Add `warning:` to anything hard to undo. It renders *before* the instruction — a caution somebody
meets after the fact is decoration.

## Replace a Corex guide

Guides are keyed by id, so registering your own under a Corex id replaces it:

```php
Guide::for( 'corex-publishing', __( 'How we publish here', 'perego' ) )
```

## Without a container

If you cannot reach the container, use the filter. Anything returned that is not a `Guide` is
discarded rather than rendered — this screen is what somebody opens when they are already stuck.

```php
add_filter( 'corex_guides', static function ( array $guides ): array {
    $guides[] = ( new ProjectsGuide() )->guide();

    return $guides;
} );
```

## Screenshots

A step can carry one:

```php
use Corex\Guides\GuideScreenshot;

new GuideStep(
    __( 'Choose Projects.', 'perego' ),
    __( 'The list opens.', 'perego' ),
    screenshot: new GuideScreenshot( 'projects-list', __( 'The Projects list.', 'perego' ) ),
);
```

The `alt` text is required, not optional — a screenshot with no text alternative is a step a
screen-reader user simply does not get.

The capture id links the image to the script that produces it in both directions: the script fails
loudly for an id it was asked for and could not capture, and a reviewer can find the code behind any
image in the tree. Corex captures its own with
`node tests/e2e/capture-guide-screenshots.mjs`; add your ids to your own equivalent so your images
cannot quietly stop matching your product.

## Guides for inactive features

There is nothing to do. Register your guides from your own service provider, and a deactivated
plugin registers nothing — so its guides are simply absent. No `is_active()` check, and no list of
plugin slugs to keep in step with reality.

## When the guides are not enough

A reader who did not find their answer needs a person, not another page. The Guides screen ends with
a **Still stuck?** panel: a category, a message, and their email, sent to the address the site owner
configured.

### Changing the address

Two ways, and the second wins:

1. **In code.** `addons/corex-guides/config/guides.php` — one line.

   ```php
   return [
       'support' => [
           'email'   => 'support@example.com',
           'enabled' => true,
       ],
   ];
   ```

2. **In the admin.** *CoreX Settings → Guides → Support email*. This writes the
   `corex_guides_support_email` option, which layers over the file, so a site owner can change it
   without a deploy. Leave it blank to fall back to the shipped address.

Setting **Offer the support form** to off removes the panel entirely. That is different from leaving
the address blank: with the panel on and no deliverable address, the screen says support is not set
up here rather than drawing a form that would discard what somebody typed.

### How the message is sent

Through Corex Mail when `addons/corex-email` is active, and through `wp_mail()` when it is not.
Neither is required — a help form must not stop working because a site does not use the mail add-on.
The reader's own address becomes the `Reply-To`, if it validates; if it does not, the header is
dropped rather than passed through.

The outcome is reported honestly. If the transport refuses the message, the panel says it did not
send and gives the text back, rather than showing a confirmation for something nobody received.

### What it will not do

- **It does not retry.** One message per user per minute, enforced server-side, so a double-click or
  a replayed POST does not arrive twice.
- **It does not store anything.** The message is an email. If you want a record, route the address
  to a shared inbox.
- **It carries no attachments** — text, the sender, and the site URL.
