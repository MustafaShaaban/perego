# Corex Product and Engineering Roadmap

**Currently released: v0.41.0.** This roadmap is the durable, owner-friendly view of where Corex is,
what must happen next, and what is intentionally deferred. It tracks milestones and dependencies
rather than repeating completed Spec Kit history.

> **Looking for what is finished and what is not?** [`PROJECT-STATUS.md`](PROJECT-STATUS.md) is the
> per-module summary, with every claim traced to the file that records it. This roadmap is the plan
> behind it. If the two ever disagree, `PROJECT-STATUS.md` is describing the code and this file is
> describing the intention — fix the one that is wrong rather than reading past it.

## 1. Roadmap purpose

This file holds **milestones, dependencies, priorities and deliberate deferrals** — the plan. It does
not hold status; `PROJECT-STATUS.md` does, and [`README.md`](README.md) carries the one table naming
which root document answers which question.

Two rules that live here and nowhere else:

- **A roadmap milestone is not authorization to implement it** (§16). A reviewed spec in `specs/` is.
- Approved design work moves from the `design/` inventory to a focused handoff, then to an engineering
  spec. Design exploration is not implementation scope by itself.

## Roadmap at a glance

| Milestone | Status | Priority | Main dependency |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 - Stabilization, Security, and Release Hygiene | Closed in v0.27.0 | Complete | Environment-gated wp-env/browser/deployment evidence remains follow-up verification |
| M1 - Design Inventory and Design-to-Engineering Pipeline | Current design package frozen; handoff intake active | High | Approved Claude Design inventory and handoffs |
| M2 - CoreX Brand Tokens and Visual Foundation | Closed: Spec 057 (T001-T090) merged via PR #54 (`f9994f8`); env-gated wp-env/browser evidence remains follow-up | Complete | Done; remaining follow-up is env-gated wp-env/browser evidence and an owner release/version decision |
| M3 - Header, Mobile Navigation, Mega Menu, and Footer System | Spec 058 implemented (US1-US4) on PR #56; env-gated browser evidence outstanding | High | M1, M2 (met) |
| M4 - Full Company Site Kit v1 | Spec 059 core implemented (full v1 page coverage + demo levels + SEO) on PR; M5 section blocks + make:site token inheritance are recorded gaps | High | M0, M2, M3 (met); selected M5 blocks |
| M5 - Blocks and Components Expansion | Planned in batches | High | M1 and approved component handoffs |
| M6 - CoreX Admin Product Experience | **Landed (merged via PR #59).** PR #58 delivered the truthful-state foundation; the Spec 060 admin-design implementation applied the complete approved visual system — real `wp-login.php` design, the full-bleed shell across every CoreX screen, the Data explorer, real Settings tabs, and provider-specific Captcha — render-verified dark + light | Medium-high | M2 (met) and stable admin contracts |
| Team-safe company-site readiness (Spec 061) | **Released v0.29.0.** Role Gate (4 modes) + start prompts + `sites/<client>/` source layout + handoff format + make:site governance stubs; shared-host `dist` builder/verifier + Azure pipeline + deploy docs; CoreX Media settings UI + `regenerate-webp` CLI + delivery seam; make:site flat `<slug>-site`/`<slug>-theme` layout + header/footer/front-page override scaffolding + `--starter` image pipeline | High | v0.28.0 (met) |
| Pre-site asset & media hardening (Spec 062) | **Released v0.30.0.** First-class `Corex\Assets\Style/Script/Image/Picture` helpers (SCSS-source-only guard); generated client SCSS/JS/image pipeline using the helpers; WebP activation gate (served only when it passes) + tracked `_corex_webp` meta; `media reset-webp` cleanup CLI; dist client-asset verification. **Priority 2 started:** CoreX UI image blocks (Hero/Gallery/Team) opt into the optimized-delivery seam. Remaining Priority 2 (not blockers): manual M6 RTL/200%/keyboard sweep, Arabic team-workflow docs mirror, PR #60 Astro 7, curated WP Font Library | High | v0.29.0 (met) |
| M7 - Forms and Email Experience | Planned | Medium-high | M2 and existing forms/mail foundations |
| M8 - Portfolio Kit Completion | Planned | Medium | M2, M3, reusable M5 blocks |
| M9 - WooCommerce Kit Completion | Waiting for Woo design and stable gating | Medium | M0, M2, M3, WooCommerce gating |
| M10 - Docs and Marketing Productization | Later; before public/commercial launch | Medium | Stable product surfaces and visual system |
| M11 - Pro and Commercial Layer | Future | Low until Core/Core kits are stable | Stable Free/Core product |

## Current focus and execution order

- **Active now:** nothing. No feature spec is open, and the next one is an owner decision — see §17.
- **Blocked:** M3 cannot enter engineering without an approved navigation handoff and the reviewed M2 token
  contract. M4 cannot start until the minimum M2/M3 foundations and selected M5 components are ready.
- **Not authorized:** roadmap presence does not authorize implementation, Pro work, builders, or bulk spec creation.

Before the first real company websites, CoreX requires the M0 release, an approved and implementable M2 visual
foundation, reusable M3 navigation/template parts, the complete M4 company-page contract, and only the M5 component
batches proven necessary by that kit.

## 2. What already exists

**This section states dependencies, not status.** What is built, partial or planned — with the file that
records each one — is [`PROJECT-STATUS.md`](PROJECT-STATUS.md), and that is the only place it is stated.
It used to be stated here too, in a table that fell three releases behind the one beside it.

The foundations the milestones below build on are in place: the core framework, the data layer, the CLI and
`make:site`, the block engine, forms, the admin product surface, the add-on architecture and its runtime
gating, the site-kit foundations, the design-token system, and the published documentation. Each carries its
own named gaps, and those gaps are what M1–M11 close.

The Free/Pro boundary matrix protects adoption and security basics in Free/Core; its commercial
implementation is M11. The release workflow — dependency policy, CI, CodeQL, branch protection,
Dependabot security updates and secret scanning — is in place and gates every pull request.

The current release baseline and exact verification counts belong in `PROGRESS.md` and
`CHANGELOG.md`, not here.

## 3. M0 - Stabilization, Security, and Release Hygiene

**Status:** Closed in v0.27.0 on 2026-06-19.
**Outcome:** A clean, evidence-backed post-readiness release suitable for the first client work.

- **Complete:** Dependabot/security triage and Spec 056 exposure-aware dependency remediation.
- **Complete:** current vulnerability findings are either resolved or explicitly classified with bounded,
  fail-closed policy entries and review triggers.
- **Complete:** GitHub branch protection, the required CI context, Dependabot security updates, and secret scanning
  were verified after Spec 056 merged.
- **Complete:** CI, CodeQL, dependency-security validation, full headless tests, builds, docs, and local readiness
  passed for the merged remediation.
- **Complete:** the v0.27.0 release commit was merged through PR #52, required CI and CodeQL passed, the annotated
  tag was pushed, and the GitHub release was published and verified against merge commit `a9abdcb`.
- **Environment-gated:** run wp-env and browser E2E when Docker and a compatible browser-automation Node runtime are
  available; unavailable checks must remain explicit rather than being reported as passing.

**Blocked or environment-dependent:** available Docker/wp-env runtime, browser automation, and external deployment
profiles. These do not reopen M0 or completed Spec 056 work, but they remain explicit readiness evidence gaps to
collect when those environments are available.

## 4. M1 - Design Inventory and Design-to-Engineering Pipeline

**Status:** Repository structure complete; current external design package reported frozen after final closure;
focused handoff intake remains active.
**Outcome:** Design exploration stays separate from engineering while approved work becomes implementable in controlled increments.

- Treat Claude Design as the source for design exploration, not as repository implementation authority.
- Maintain a design inventory covering foundations, navigation, blocks, kits, admin UI, forms/email, docs, marketing, responsive behavior, RTL, accessibility, states, and performance notes.
- Keep the design roadmap under `design/` separate from this engineering roadmap.
- Maintain `design/ROADMAP.md`, `design/INVENTORY.md`, and focused documents in `design/handoffs/`.
- Convert only approved, implementation-ready design areas into handoffs and then engineering specs.
- Do not implement every design idea immediately or create detailed specs for the entire inventory at once.

Claude Design remains outside the repository. Its explorations become engineering inputs only after an approval
record is captured in the design inventory and a focused handoff defines responsive behavior, states,
accessibility, RTL, performance constraints, and implementation boundaries.

## 5. M2 - CoreX Brand Tokens and Visual Foundation

**Status:** Closed. Spec 057 (T001-T090) merged to `main` via PR #54 (merge commit `f9994f8`): canonical tokens,
accessible modes/typography/RTL, the four-file font package, the approved Core X logo package (five SVG variants +
provenance manifest), the brand-override validator, the scoped `--corex-admin-*` admin adapter, and the
design-system/branding documentation. Only environment-gated wp-env/browser evidence remains as explicit follow-up,
plus an owner release/version decision (no version is cut here). The legacy navy/cyan SVG is retained only as
rollback evidence.
**Outcome:** One accessible, brandable visual foundation shared by front-end, admin product UI, docs, and marketing.

- New CoreX logo system and usage rules.
- Final typography system, including Arabic font roles and fallbacks.
- Final semantic color tokens and brass/gold accent behavior.
- `theme.json` and runtime token alignment.
- Admin/product visual base.
- Dark-first and light-mode behavior.
- RTL typography and mixed-script rules.
- Accessibility baseline for color contrast, focus, type scaling, and motion.
- Design-system documentation update.

Implementation must preserve client brandability: CoreX product identity must not become a hardcoded client-site identity.

## 6. M3 - Header, Mobile Navigation, Mega Menu, and Footer System

**Status:** Spec 058 implemented (US1-US4) on PR #56 (draft → ready): six header variants, four `<details>`-based
mega menus, six footer variants, the buildless behavior script (single-open/Escape/outside-click/sticky-transparent),
keyboard/focus/RTL/reduced-motion/no-JS, and conditional asset loading. Full `composer test`/`test:js`/`build`/
docs-app build pass; rendered browser/RTL/reduced-motion + wp-env evidence remains ENVIRONMENT-GATED. WooCommerce
navigation/footer deferred to M9.
**Outcome:** Reusable template parts that cover company, product, docs, and commerce navigation without requiring a builder.

- Header variants: simple company, corporate with top bar, SaaS/product, docs, WooCommerce, transparent hero, minimal landing, and RTL examples.
- Mobile navigation: drawer, full-screen menu, nested accordion, and mobile mega-menu accordion.
- Mega menus: simple dropdown, services, product/features, docs/resources, and WooCommerce categories.
- Mega-menu item anatomy: optional icon, title, description, badge, link, featured card, and CTA.
- Sticky and transparent-to-solid behavior.
- Search overlay, language switcher, CTA slot, account slot, and cart slot.
- Footer variants: simple, corporate, SaaS, WooCommerce, newsletter, locations, legal, and RTL examples.
- Reusable FSE template parts and patterns.
- Defined keyboard, focus, escape, outside-click, mobile, reduced-motion, and RTL behavior.

Do not turn this milestone into a header builder or mega-menu builder.

## 7. M4 - Full Company Site Kit v1

**Status:** High priority after M0, M2, and M3.
**Outcome:** A neutral, brand-aware company kit that can launch the first real Corex company websites.

Required page coverage:

- Home
- About
- Services
- Single Service
- Case Studies / Work
- Single Case Study
- Industries
- FAQ
- Blog / News
- Single Post
- Team
- Testimonials
- Locations / Branches
- Contact
- Privacy Policy
- Terms
- Cookie Policy
- Search Results
- No Results
- 404
- Maintenance

Required kit behavior:

- Preview/apply UX with an explicit summary before mutation.
- Brand-aware setup fields without embedding a client brand in Corex.
- Demo content levels: minimal, standard, and full.
- Safe reset, adopt, skip, and conflict behavior for existing content.
- SEO starter metadata that remains editable and plugin-compatible.
- Accessibility, RTL, responsive, content-overflow, and mobile checks.

M4 should reuse approved native blocks and patterns. It must not absorb unrelated Pro workflows.

## 8. M5 - Blocks and Components Expansion

**Status:** High priority; implement in reviewed batches.
**Outcome:** Fill proven company-site and product-UI gaps without creating a page-builder-sized library.

Front-end block/component candidates:

- Services grid and service detail
- Process/steps and icon box
- Logo cloud and trust badges
- Case study grid and project card
- Rich tabs with InnerBlocks/full content support
- Shared slider/carousel system
- Testimonial, gallery, and logo carousels
- Featured posts and newsletter signup
- Contact info cards and map/location section
- Timeline, video modal, and before/after
- Pricing comparison
- Related posts/projects

Admin/product component candidates:

- Add-on card, dependency card, readiness checklist, status card, and metric card
- Empty state, skeleton, toast, data table, and filter bar

Required rules:

- Do not load slider JavaScript globally.
- Use no autoplay by default; any enabled autoplay must expose pause and stop on interaction.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Provide keyboard operation, visible focus, usable labels, and announcements where needed.
- Support RTL direction, arrow semantics, swipe direction, and item order.
- Provide a server-rendered, usable fallback where possible.
- Batch work by real kit need; prefer WordPress core blocks, styles, and patterns when they satisfy the requirement.

## 9. M6 - CoreX Admin Product Experience

**Status:** **Landed (merged via PR #59).** PR #58 delivered the truthful-state foundation (the seven-state add-on
model, state-aware settings, captcha/reCAPTCHA handling, write-only secrets, scoped Add-ons badges); the Spec 060
admin-design implementation then applied the complete approved visual layer and is render-verified (Playwright,
dark + light). The real `wp-login.php` carries the CoreX login design (branded mark, ambient grid + glow, a separate
disabled SSO slot + "or" divider, leading field icons, brass button, reduced-motion-aware entrance; dark-first, and
the saved appearance controls it logged-out). Every CoreX admin screen — Overview, Settings, Add-ons, Data,
Insights, Setup Wizard, and declarative option pages — uses the full-bleed `COREX FRAMEWORK` shell. The Data screen
is a truthful explorer (rail-driven source, real 14-day chart, derived schema, bulk delete, accessible drawer);
Settings uses real tabs with a live appearance setting; **Captcha settings are provider-specific** (None, Honeypot,
reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Cloudflare Turnstile — each showing only its own fields/links). Dark-first + complete light
mode, RTL, focus/disabled/reduced-motion, allow-listed to CoreX screens/login only — no global wp-admin or public
restyle; secrets write-only. **Outcome:** A coherent operational surface for setup, configuration, add-ons, data,
and readiness. Remaining manual acceptance (RTL mirroring, 200% zoom, full-keyboard sweep) is backlog.

- Dashboard polish.
- Add-ons UI.
- Data UI.
- Settings UI.
- Setup wizard.
- Readiness/status screen.
- Free and Pro badges.
- Dependency missing, feature flag off, WooCommerce missing, and Pro required states.
- Installed/not installed and active/inactive states.
- Loading, empty, error, success, and permission-denied states.
- Future-aware license-expired state without implementing licensing early.

Heavy animation and commercial licensing workflows are not part of this milestone.

## 10. M7 - Forms and Email Experience

**Status:** Medium-high priority.
**Outcome:** Accessible form interactions and consistent branded transactional communication.

- Field anatomy, help text, required/optional treatment, and grouping.
- Validation states and accessible error summaries.
- Submit loading, success, and failure states.
- Captcha failed, honeypot triggered, and file upload rejected states.
- Admin notification email.
- User/contact confirmation email.
- Newsletter confirmation email.
- Shared branded email tokens with safe light/dark email-client behavior.

Password/reset email styling may be documented for future auth work but does not authorize a full auth/profile system.

## 11. M8 - Portfolio Kit Completion

**Status:** Medium priority.
**Outcome:** A neutral portfolio kit for studios, agencies, consultants, and independent professionals.

- Home
- Projects
- Single Project
- About
- Services
- Process
- Testimonials
- Contact
- Project archive with accessible filters
- Project categories

Reuse M3 navigation and approved M5 project/case-study components.

## 12. M9 - WooCommerce Kit Completion

**Status:** After WooCommerce design and runtime gating are stable.
**Outcome:** A complete, performant WooCommerce presentation kit that remains optional.

The kit must retain dual gating: WooCommerce availability and Corex add-on activation. Advanced WooCommerce internals are not included.

## 13. M10 - Docs and Marketing Productization

**Status:** Later; required before public/commercial launch.
**Outcome:** Product-quality learning, reference, and launch surfaces aligned with the final visual foundation.

- Docs homepage and article layout.
- Component and pattern reference pages.
- Command/reference pages.
- Search/command palette.
- GitHub README banner.
- Open Graph cards.
- ThemeForest preview.
- Release cards.

Keep generated API reference separate from curated product documentation.

## 14. M11 - Pro and Commercial Layer

**Status:** Future. Do not build before Core/Core kits are stable.
**Outcome:** Commercial packaging and advanced vertical capabilities built on a trustworthy Free/Core product.

- Add-on edition metadata and runtime Pro gating.
- Admin Pro labels.
- License key screen, validation, update entitlement, and grace behavior.
- Pro package distribution.
- White-label admin and client portal.
- Advanced newsletter and advanced WooCommerce capabilities.
- Bookings and careers/ATS.
- Multi-company identity/dashboard.

### Free/Core boundary

Free/Core retains the framework, basic blocks/DLS, forms/contact form, config/options, basic media fields, captcha/honeypot, accessibility, RTL, i18n, basic `make:site`, and basic docs/deployment guidance. Security and accessibility basics must never require Pro.

### Pro/future boundary

Advanced vertical workflows, operational automation, commercial distribution, white-labeling, entitlement, and multi-company/client operations are Pro candidates. Classification does not equal implementation approval.

## 15. Deferred / do not implement now

- Front-office editor workspace.
- Header builder.
- Mega menu builder.
- Full client portal.
- Full auth/profile system.
- Full Pro licensing UI.
- Heavy animation in wp-admin.
- Advanced WooCommerce custom internals.
- Building all design ideas at once.

These items require later validation and dedicated specs. They must not leak into M0-M5.

## 16. Spec creation policy

- Keep one master engineering roadmap: this file.
- Create detailed specs only for the next two or three implementation items.
- Implement one reviewed spec at a time.
- Every implementation spec must include goal, scope, out of scope, files likely affected, acceptance criteria, tests/checks, and rollback notes.
- Design-approved items become focused handoff documents first, then engineering specs.
- Do not create code directly from design exploration without a reviewed engineering spec.
- Update roadmap status when priorities or dependencies change; do not rewrite completed spec history into the roadmap.

## 17. Next recommended specs

Nothing here is authorized by appearing here (§16). One reviewed spec at a time.

**What has already shipped is not listed.** It used to be — roughly two hundred lines narrating every
merged spec, its PR number and its test counts, restated from `CHANGELOG.md` and going stale between
releases. `CHANGELOG.md` is where a released change is recorded; `git log` is where a merge is.

The standing rule that governed those specs still governs the next one: **the approved current design
is the functional contract**, and a required control may not remain sample, planned, future,
reference-only, read-only, placeholder-only or dead. An absent optional dependency may gate its
dependent behaviour only with a working install/activate/connect path. (DECISIONS #115.)

### Candidates for a later spec — owner decision

Nothing is authorized by appearing here (§16). Listed so the choice is informed, roughly by cost:

- **Capability Inspector / System Map.** Spec 074 adds a bounded capability summary to the Models screen
  (what is registered, what it can do, what is missing, where to act). A full cross-module system map — every
  provider, seam, job, and integration with live health — is the natural successor and is deliberately *not*
  in 074's scope.

- ~~**Astro 7 migration for `docs-app`.**~~ Done in spec 089 — `astro@7.1.5` + `@astrojs/starlight@0.41.5`,
  286 pages, no config change. The packaging question that held it turned out not to be independent: expanding
  the `corex-framework` `file:..` workspace root into the docs tree only mattered while the *root* tooling was
  dirty, so fixing the root removed the blocker. The regenerated lockfile contains no root dev tooling at all.
- **The three excluded browser specs.** Two block-editor specs trade a first-open failure between them, and one
  flow-builder spec times out mid-interaction; each carries its ruled-out causes in
  `tests/e2e/playwright.config.js`. Real coverage gaps, already diagnosed down to "needs fresh eyes".
- ~~**`wp corex version` completeness.**~~ Closed twice. PR #126 in **v0.35.1** brought `docs-app/src/version.ts`
  into reach; cutting **v0.39.0** found that `package.json`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and both status pages were
  still stamped by hand — which is how this file came to sit three releases behind a correct README. All are
  stamped now (DECISIONS #205).
- ~~**The 24 bounded dependency exceptions.**~~ Closed by spec 089. The policy file holds none, and
  `verify:dependencies` passes across Composer, npm-root and npm-docs.
- **M3/M4 product tracks** (§6–§7), which remain the substantive product direction and are the only items here
  that would be a *feature* spec rather than remediation.

Spec number 056 remains unavailable. Specs 066, 067 and **086** are historical branch/decision identifiers without durable
feature directories; do not reuse them.
