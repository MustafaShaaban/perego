# Corex — Working Guide & Continuity Protocol

**How to use this library, how to keep building it, and how any human or AI agent picks up where the last one left off.**

> Read this together with `COREX-FRAMEWORK.md` (the architecture reference). That document explains *what* Corex is. This one explains *how to work on it and with it* — and how to never lose continuity.

## Part A — The Continuity Protocol (read this first)

The single biggest risk in an AI-built project is **lost context**: a new session, a different LLM, or a new teammate starts cold and makes decisions that contradict earlier ones. This protocol prevents that.

### A.1 — The source-of-truth hierarchy

When anything conflicts, resolve in this order (top wins):

1. **`specs/constitution.md`** — the non-negotiable rules.
2. **`COREX-FRAMEWORK.md`** — the architecture reference.
3. **The active spec** in `specs/` for the module being built.
4. **`PROGRESS.md`** — what is done, in progress, and next.
5. **The code** — the current implementation.

If code contradicts the constitution, the code is wrong, not the constitution.

### A.2 — Required files at the repo root (the agent entry points)

Every agent reads these before doing anything. Keep them current.

| File | Purpose | Who reads it |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code entry point — points to the docs below | Claude Code |
| `AGENTS.md` | Generic agent entry point (Codex, Cursor, etc.) | All other LLMs |
| `specs/constitution.md` | The rules | All agents |
| `COREX-FRAMEWORK.md` | Architecture reference | All agents + humans |
| `COREX-WORKING-GUIDE.md` | This file | All agents + humans |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Live status + next steps | All agents + humans |
| `DECISIONS.md` | Decision log (why we chose X over Y) | All agents + humans |

`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` should be near-identical and short — they just orient the agent and hand off to the real docs. Example content is in §A.5.

### A.3 — The "always recommend next step" rule

**Every agent, at the end of every response, must end with a `NEXT STEP` block.** This is mandatory and goes in the constitution. It is what makes the project resumable by anyone.

The block has exactly this shape:

```
---
NEXT STEP
- Just completed: <one line>
- Recommended next: <one specific, actionable step>
- Why: <one line>
- Alternatives: <optional — other valid directions>
- Blockers/decisions needed from you: <optional>
---
```

Because the agent always states the recommended next step, you (or the next LLM) never have to reconstruct where things stand — you read the last `NEXT STEP` and continue. Pair this with `PROGRESS.md` (§A.4), which records the same information durably.

### A.4 — `PROGRESS.md` (the living status file)

Updated at the end of every working session — by the agent, automatically. Structure:

```markdown
# Corex — Progress

## Done
- [x] corex-core: Boot.php + DI container
- [x] corex-core: ControllerMap auto-discovery

## In progress
- [ ] QueryBuilder — where/orderBy done, eager loading (with) pending

## Next (recommended order)
1. Finish QueryBuilder eager loading + tests
2. make:model generator
3. Field driver abstraction (ACF-optional)

## Open decisions
- Logger: PSR-3 + which monitoring adapter? (see DECISIONS.md #7)

## Last session summary
2026-06-07 — built container + boot. Next: QueryBuilder.
```

A new session's first action is: **read `PROGRESS.md`, then continue from "Next."**

### A.5 — Example `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`

```markdown
# Corex — Agent Entry Point

You are working on Corex, a Laravel-inspired WordPress framework.

BEFORE doing anything:
1. Read `specs/constitution.md` — the rules. They override everything.
2. Read `PROGRESS.md` — current status and the recommended next step.
3. Read the relevant spec in `specs/` for the module you're touching.
4. Skim `COREX-FRAMEWORK.md` for the architecture if unfamiliar.

WHILE working:
- Follow the constitution exactly. If a request conflicts with it, say so.
- Use the `wp corex make:*` generators rather than hand-writing boilerplate.
- Keep controllers thin; logic goes in services; data access in repositories.
- All styling via theme.json CSS variables. No hardcoded values. No CSS frameworks.

AFTER producing any code:
- Run the relevant guard skill on the diff ($wp-guard, $woo-guard,
  $clean-code-guard, $test-guard, $docs-guard) before presenting.
- Update `PROGRESS.md`.
- Log any non-trivial decision in `DECISIONS.md`.
- End your response with a NEXT STEP block (see constitution §"Next Step Rule").
```

### A.6 — `DECISIONS.md` (the decision log)

Records *why*, so no future agent re-litigates a settled choice. One entry per decision:

```markdown
## #12 — No CSS framework in shipped output
Date: 2026-06-07
Decision: Drop Bootstrap/Tailwind from shipped CSS; use theme.json CSS vars.
Why: HHEO proved build-time tokens block per-client theming + add page weight.
Alternatives considered: Tailwind (rejected: build-time tokens), Bootstrap (rejected: weight).
Status: Final.
```

### A.7 — Single Workspace / Agent Coordination Rule

So that Claude, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, and any future agent all work from the same source of truth and never
recreate or overwrite each other's work. This **extends, never replaces**, the source-of-truth hierarchy (§A.1),
the Spec Kit flow (§D.2), and the multi-agent ownership rules (§D.3a).

- **The active PR branch is the working source of truth.** While a feature PR is open, its branch is where all
  work continues. Read `PROGRESS.md` for the latest pushed state and continue from the **latest commit on that
  branch** — never restart completed work or branch off elsewhere.
- **One checkout: the normal project root.** Work from the normal project root checkout only. Do **not** create or
  work inside hidden/separate `git worktree` directories (e.g. `.worktrees/…`) by default — using one requires the
  owner's **explicit** approval for that session. If a session finds itself in a non-root or worktree path, it
  **stops**, reports that it is not the normal root, and names the correct root path before editing.
- **Verify before editing (pre-flight).** Before changing any file, run and read:
  ```bash
  git rev-parse --show-toplevel   # confirm the normal project root
  git branch --show-current       # confirm the active branch
  git status --short              # confirm a known, clean-or-expected tree
  git log --oneline -5            # confirm the latest pushed commit
  git remote -v                   # confirm origin
  git worktree list               # confirm a single, expected worktree
  git fetch origin                # see remote state
  ```
- **Stop conditions.** Stop and report, making **no edits**, if any of these is true: you are on the **wrong
  branch**; you are in the **wrong checkout** (not the normal root, or an unapproved worktree); or the tree has
  **uncommitted changes you did not create** and cannot account for. Do not stash, discard, commit, or overwrite
  unknown changes without owner direction.
- **Continue, don't recreate.** Resume from the latest pushed commit on the active branch. Tasks already complete
  (per `PROGRESS.md` and the spec's `tasks.md`) are not redone.
- **Push discipline.** Commit and push only to the active PR branch while its PR is open. Never push to `main`;
  never merge or mark a PR ready while blockers remain.
- **End-of-session handoff (mandatory).** Every session ends with a handoff containing, in order: **SUMMARY**,
  **WORKSPACE**, **SPEC KIT STATUS**, **VERIFICATION**, **BLOCKERS / DECISIONS NEEDED**, **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP**,
  and the **NEXT STEP** block (§A.3, unchanged and still mandatory as the final element). This makes the workspace
  state and the resume point explicit for the next human or agent.

## Part B — Quality Gates (the guard skills)

Adopt the [guard-skills](https://github.com/amElnagdy/guard-skills) as the enforcement layer for the constitution.

**Auto-install rule (put in the constitution):** before running a guard, the agent checks whether it is installed. If it is not, the agent installs it first, then uses it. No diff ships without its guard — a missing guard is never an excuse to skip the gate.

```bash
# Install per agent (example: Claude Code)
npx skills add amElnagdy/guard-skills --skill wp-guard --agent claude-code
npx skills add amElnagdy/guard-skills --skill woo-guard --agent claude-code
npx skills add amElnagdy/guard-skills --skill clean-code-guard --agent claude-code
npx skills add amElnagdy/guard-skills --skill test-guard --agent claude-code
npx skills add amElnagdy/guard-skills --skill docs-guard --agent claude-code

# If a guard is missing when needed, the agent runs the matching line above
# automatically before proceeding.
```

**When to run which guard:**

| After the agent changed | Run |
|---|---|
| Any production code | `$clean-code-guard` |
| WP plugin/theme/block/REST/AJAX/query | `$wp-guard` |
| WooCommerce code | `$woo-guard` (on top of wp-guard) |
| Test code | `$test-guard` |
| Docs / README / docstrings | `$docs-guard` |

**Definition of done** (put in the constitution): no diff is presented or merged until the relevant guard runs clean on it. The constitution is the law; the guards are the inspector.

> Also worth knowing: `WordPress/agent-skills` is the broader build-time catalog. Use it to *build*, guard-skills to *check*.

## Part C — Using the Library (consumer workflow)

For a developer *using* Corex to build a site (not building the framework itself).

### C.1 — Start a project
```bash
composer create-project corex/framework my-site
cd my-site
wp corex init --namespace="Acme" --prefix="acme" --mode=fse
npx wp-env start
composer install && npm install && npm run build
```

### C.2 — Apply a client brand (the design intake — see Framework doc §10)
1. Put the client's palette, fonts, and scale into `theme/theme.json`.
2. For per-site variants, create `brand.json` with overrides.
3. Self-host fonts (variable + unicode-range subset).
4. Run `wp corex brand:apply`.

### C.3 — Add a feature
```bash
wp corex make:model Product --cpt --rest --ability
wp corex make:service ProductService
wp corex make:controller ProductController
wp corex make:block product-grid --dynamic
```
Declare fields on the model (works with or without ACF), implement the service, register a connector so editors bind blocks to fields.

### C.4 — Enable optional modules
```bash
wp corex install corex/forms
wp corex install corex/profile-manager
```

### C.5 — Ship
```bash
wp corex health:check       # audit before deploy
# commit → PR → CI gates → merge → tag release
```

---

## Part D — Developing the Library (contributor workflow)

For working *on* Corex itself.

### D.1 — Golden rules
- Never put business logic in the theme.
- Never instantiate dependencies inside methods — inject them.
- Never hardcode a color, size, or font — use tokens.
- Never load an asset globally — scope it to a block.
- Never write a security check by hand — declare middleware.
- Never make an optional plugin (ACF, Woo, WPML) a hard dependency.

### D.2 — The spec-first loop (Spec Kit)
```
/constitution   → write/update the rules
/specify        → describe the module's behavior
/clarify        → resolve ambiguities
/plan           → technical plan
/tasks          → break into tasks
/implement      → build one task, review, repeat
```
Write the spec before the code. The spec is the durable artifact.

### D.3 — Per-task cycle
1. Pick the next task from `PROGRESS.md`.
2. Generate scaffolding with `wp corex make:*`.
3. Implement following the constitution.
4. Write tests (Pest unit, Playwright E2E).
5. Run the relevant guard on the diff.
6. Update `PROGRESS.md` + `DECISIONS.md`.
7. End with a `NEXT STEP` block.
8. PR into `develop` → green CI → merge.

### D.3a - Multi-agent work ownership

When more than one agent or human can touch the repo, every work unit starts with status and ownership:

1. Run `git status --short --branch` before editing.
2. Confirm the work branch is a feature branch, never `main`.
3. Record the active spec path, task IDs, and files owned for the work unit.
4. Do not overlap owned files with another active work unit unless a handoff explicitly transfers ownership.
5. Before marking a work unit complete, attach verification evidence and the relevant guard results.
6. Handoffs and final reports name branch, spec path, completed task IDs, files owned, verification,
   guard status, and any files released for another agent.

The release readiness gate models this as an agent work unit: `main` is invalid for active work, overlapping
file ownership blocks completion, and missing guard evidence keeps a completed task from being accepted.

### D.4 - Definition of done (per feature)

- [ ] Follows the constitution
- [ ] Generated via CLI where applicable
- [ ] Unit + E2E tests, green
- [ ] Relevant guard run clean
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 AA for any UI
- [ ] Strings translation-ready (i18n)
- [ ] RTL verified
- [ ] Docs updated **in the same change** per the rule in §D.5 (docs-guard checks drift)
- [ ] `PROGRESS.md` updated

### D.5 — The documentation-in-every-PR rule (mandatory)

**Every feature PR updates its documentation in the same change — without being asked.** A feature is not done
when the code works; it is done when the docs that describe it are true again. This rule exists because the
2026-06-14 audit found shipped backends whose user-facing docs still claimed earlier (or no) capability — the
root `README.md` still said "bootstrap stage, no framework code yet" long after the framework existed.

**Surface ↔ change mapping** — for the change you made, update *every* surface that applies:

| You changed | Update, in the same PR |
|---|---|
| A plugin/add-on's behavior, options, or public API | that plugin/add-on's `README.md` (what it does · what enabling gives · what disabling removes · required config/keys · related CLI commands · related docs · limitations) |
| A user- or developer-facing capability | the matching `docs-app/src/content/docs/guides/*` guide |
| Anything a newcomer/evaluator would see | the root `README.md` (kept honest — no overclaiming; backend-only means backend-only; env-gated means clearly env-gated) |
| A CLI command or flag | `packages/cli/README.md` + the CLI guide |
| Architecture | `COREX-FRAMEWORK.md` (its §26 rule) |
| Agent-facing behavior or entry points | `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` |
| Status / what's done / what's next | `PROGRESS.md`; a non-trivial choice → `DECISIONS.md` |

**Honesty clause.** Docs must not overclaim. State capability at the level it actually ships:
*implemented and tested*, *backend-only (UI pending)*, or *env-gated (needs a browser/host to verify)* — never
flatten those into "done/complete". A task checkbox is checked only when the code satisfies it.

**Not your job to hand-edit:** the generated class reference under `docs-app/.../reference/*` is regenerated by
`wp corex docs:generate`, never corrected by hand — re-run the generator instead.

**Gate.** `docs-guard` runs clean on every changed doc before the diff ships (Part B). A docs-only omission
fails the Definition of Done just like a failing test.

---

## Part E — How Any LLM Continues the Work

This is the answer to "make sure any LLM can continue working on this."

1. **Cold start sequence** for a fresh agent (state this in `AGENTS.md`):
   read `constitution.md` → `PROGRESS.md` → active spec → continue from "Next."
2. **Model-agnostic by design** — Spec Kit, the guard skills, and the entry files all work across Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini. Nothing is Claude-only.
3. **Durable memory lives in files, not chat** — `PROGRESS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and the specs are the project's memory. Chat history is disposable; these files are not.
4. **The NEXT STEP block** at the end of every response means the handoff point is always explicit.
5. **The guards** mean a different LLM can't quietly violate the standards — the gate catches it.

The test of success: a brand-new LLM, given only the repo, can read four files and correctly state what to build next — without you explaining anything.

---

## Part F — Maintenance

- Update `PROGRESS.md` every session (agent does this automatically).
- Log decisions in `DECISIONS.md` as they happen.
- Update `COREX-FRAMEWORK.md` in the *same PR* as any architectural change.
- Run `wp corex docs:generate` in CI to keep auto-derived docs from drifting.
- Re-run `docs-guard` on doc changes before shipping.

## Part G — Team-Safe Roles, Source Layout & Handoff (spec 061)

CoreX is now used to build real client sites. To keep framework work and client work from colliding, every
session — human or AI — runs through four gates in order:

> **Role Gate** decides *where* you work · **Spec Kit** decides *what* to build · **Guard Gate** decides
> *whether* code/docs are safe to ship · **UI/UX ProMax** decides *whether* visible UI/design is good enough.

### G.1 — Source layout (where things live)

- **Repo root is the source of truth.** The team develops in the repo. Git commits **source only**.
- **Framework** source: `plugins/`, `addons/`, `packages/`, root `theme/`, root `specs/`, root `docs/`, `docs-app/`.
- **Client/company-site** source: `sites/<client>/` —
  ```text
  sites/<client>/
    <client>-site/     # the client plugin (app/business code)
    <client>-theme/    # the client theme (presentation)
    AGENTS.md  CLAUDE.md  README.md  PROGRESS.md  DECISIONS.md
    specs/  docs/
  ```
- **Never edited as source** (runtime/build output): `wp/wp-content/` and `dist/`. `dist/` is generated by the
  shared-host builder and is git-ignored — never committed. The server receives only the contents of `dist/`.

### G.2 — The four modes (Role Gate)

| Mode | Edits | Source-of-truth | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CoreX Framework** | `plugins/`,`addons/`,`packages/`,root `theme/`/`specs/`/`docs/`,`docs-app/`,`ROADMAP.md`,root `PROGRESS.md`, framework UI, release | root agent files, `specs/constitution.md`, this guide, `COREX-FRAMEWORK.md` | edit `sites/<client>/` (unless authorized) |
| **Client Site** | `sites/<client>/` only | root files (global safety) + `sites/<client>/{AGENTS,CLAUDE,PROGRESS,DECISIONS}.md` + `sites/<client>/specs/` | continue the CoreX roadmap; edit framework dirs (unless authorized) |
| **Deployment** | `dist` builder, `azure-pipelines.yml`, deploy/rollback scripts, runtime-file protection | this guide §G.4, deployment docs | client-design or framework-product changes beyond packaging |
| **Docs/Planning** | docs, specs, roadmap, decisions, prompts, handoffs | the file being edited | ship runtime code (unless authorized) |

Copy/paste start prompts for each mode: `docs/en/04-team-workflow/ai-agent-start-prompts.md`.

### G.3 — Guard Gate & UI/UX ProMax

- **Guard Gate** (run the relevant one on every diff before it ships): `clean-code-guard` (production code),
  `wp-guard` (WP/plugin/theme/block/REST/AJAX/query), `woo-guard` (WooCommerce), `test-guard` (tests),
  `docs-guard` (docs). Where a named guard skill has no executable command in the environment, the documented
  fallback is this repo's real validation (`composer validate`, `php -l`, `vendor/bin/pest`, `npx jest`,
  `npm run lint:css/js`, `npm run build`, docs-app build, `npm run verify:dependencies`, `git diff --check`).
- **UI/UX ProMax** is required for all UI-facing work — framework (admin/login/dashboard/add-ons/docs app) and
  client (homepage/inner pages/header-footer/blocks/templates/mobile/RTL/a11y/SEO/perf/keyboard/200%/brand).

### G.4 — Deployment split

`GitHub Actions = PR/code-quality gates` · `Azure Pipelines = build dist + deploy to hosting`. Build a flat
artifact with `npm run build:dist` (→ `scripts/build-shared-host-dist.sh`); verify with
`npm run verify:dist`. Azure deploys from release tags, with credentials in Azure secrets and production runtime
files (`wp-config.php`, `.htaccess`, `uploads/`, `cache/`, `upgrade/`, `debug.log`) protected from overwrite.

### G.5 — Required response/handoff format

End every working response with:
```text
SUMMARY            - What was done.
WORKSPACE          - Branch: / Repo root: / Git status: / Files changed:
MODE               - Framework / Client Site / Deployment / Docs-Planning
SPEC KIT STATUS    - Spec path: / Task IDs: / Completed: / Remaining:
VERIFICATION       - Commands run: / Results: / Guards run:
PRs / RELEASE      - PR numbers: / Merge status: / Release/tag status:
BLOCKERS / DECISIONS NEEDED
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP
---
NEXT STEP
- Just completed: / Recommended next: / Why: / Alternatives: / Blockers/decisions needed from you:

```
