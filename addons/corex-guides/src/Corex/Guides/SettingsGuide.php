/**
 * Every settings section, and every field in it (spec 094).
 *
 * The requirement was "every single detail and input should be described", and Settings is where
 * that bites: nine sections, 42 fields, and a screen that otherwise explains itself only through
 * short help text written for somebody who already knows what the field is for.
 *
 * Three things are said here that the screen cannot say for itself, and they are the reason this is
 * a guide rather than more help text:
 *
 * - **A password field that looks empty may not be.** Secrets are write-only: submitting a blank one
 *   keeps the stored value. Somebody who assumes blank means unset either pastes the key again
 *   (harmless) or concludes it never saved (not).
 * - **Six captcha fields appear and disappear** with the chosen driver. A reader hunting for "Site
 *   key" on Honeypot concludes the screen is broken.
 * - **The Advanced section stores nothing.** It reads the server back to you.
 *
 * `SettingsGuideCoverageTest` asserts every key in `SettingsRegistry::keys()` is named here, so a
 * field added without documentation fails the suite rather than quietly going unexplained.
