/**
 * Corex's own guides, for the person handed a finished site (spec 084, from spec 082's content).
 *
 * Written for somebody who did not build this and does not want to learn a framework — the audience
 * spec 082 identified: they want to answer a message, publish a post, or find out why a page is
 * slow. Every step names the control it means and says what should happen, so a reader can tell
 * whether it worked without asking anybody.
 *
 * **Each guide names the capability it needs**, so a contributor who cannot open the Submissions
 * inbox is never shown instructions for it. Registered through the same public seam a site plugin
 * uses, so the seam is exercised by the framework and cannot rot unnoticed.
 *
 * Spec 094 widened this from four guides to ten, and spec 096 to sixteen — every CoreX admin screen.
 * The guides added there live under `Guides/` rather than in this one: sixteen inline would be a
 * file nobody reads to change one step. This class is now the composition point and the four
 * original guides; anything new goes in its own file.
 *
