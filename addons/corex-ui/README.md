# Corex UI

The Corex UI block library: server-rendered `corex/*` dynamic blocks plus a curated set of
token-only, accessible, RTL section patterns under a single **Corex** inserter category. Designs
are composed of these units. Optional add-on; requires `corex-core` and the `corex-blocks` engine.

> Dynamic blocks are server-rendered (spec-004 engine) with editor registration + compiled token-only
> styles via the `@wordpress/scripts` build pipeline (spec 018); content sections are block patterns.
> Run `npm run build` to compile each block's editor script + `style-index.css` (+ RTL).

## Dynamic blocks

| Block | Renders |
|---|---|
| `corex/posts` | Recent posts as accessible linked cards (`count` attribute, bounded 1–12; empty state) |
| `corex/breadcrumbs` | An accessible `nav` breadcrumb trail to the current page |
| `corex/copyright` | The current year + site name (footer line) |
| `corex/stat` | A single statistic — `value`, `label`, optional `description` |
| `corex/testimonial` | A quote with attribution — accessible `figure`/`blockquote`/`figcaption` (`quote`/`author`/`role`) |
| `corex/pricing` | A pricing card — `plan`, `price`, `period`, `features` (one per line), optional CTA |
| `corex/accordion` | Accessible disclosures from `items` (one `Title \| Content` per line) — native `<details>`, no JS |
| `corex/hero` | A page hero — `eyebrow`/`title`/`subtitle`, gated CTA, optional media-library background `image` |
| `corex/cta` | A call-to-action banner — `title`/`text` + a gated button |
| `corex/team` | A responsive grid of `members[]` — media-library photo, `name`/`role`/`bio`; nameless skipped |
| `corex/gallery` | A responsive CSS grid of `images[]` from the media library, alt text + optional captions |
| `corex/tabs` | Tabbed content from `tabs[]` — a CSS-only accessible widget with **no view JavaScript** |
| `corex/modal` | An accessible dialog — a trigger + native `<dialog>` (focus-trap, ESC, backdrop), `title`/`triggerLabel`/`content`; degrades without JS (spec 054) |
| `corex/carousel` | The one slider primitive — a scroll-snap row of `slides[]`, `perView` (1–6), opt-in `autoplay`. Swipeable and keyboard-scrollable with **no JS**; enhanced with prev/next/dot buttons. Autoplay pauses on hover/focus/tab-blur and never runs under reduced motion; RTL-correct (spec 068) |

Each is server-rendered, escaped, and token-styled; its CSS loads only where the block renders
(declared in `block.json`). The component blocks (`stat`/`testimonial`/`pricing`/`accordion` plus the
spec-035 set `hero`/`cta`/`team`/`gallery`/`tabs`) are **edited inline on the canvas** (RichText) while
staying dynamic — the renderer reads the attributes and renders rich text safely with `wp_kses_post`;
repeatable lists (pricing features, accordion panels, team members, gallery images, tabs) are inline rows.
Image blocks pick from the **media library** (storing `{id, url, alt}`, rendering real `<img>` with alt +
lazy loading), and `tabs` ships **zero front-end JavaScript** (a CSS `:checked` radio/label disclosure). The
`corex/form` block **selects a form from a dropdown** (the cap-gated `corex/v1/forms` route), not a typed slug.
(Specs 029, 035.)

## Block styles (spec 054)

Appearance-only variants registered via `register_block_style()` (no new blocks) on core blocks, in one
token-only stylesheet that loads with the block: **Card** / **Section** / **Empty state** (`core/group`),
**Striped** (`core/table`), **Secondary** / **Ghost** (`core/button`). Plus a `.corex-skeleton` loading
utility. See the [gap analysis](../../docs-app/src/content/docs/design-system/gap-analysis.md) for why these are
styles, not blocks.

## Section patterns

Under the **Corex** inserter category: **hero, features, call-to-action, testimonial, contact**, plus the spec-054
**section-header, content-split, stats, FAQ, latest-news**. The contact pattern composes the `corex/form` contact
block (spec 007); stats/FAQ/news compose `corex/stat`/`corex/accordion`/`corex/posts`. Every pattern is styled
only with `theme.json` presets (color slugs + `var:preset` spacing), uses logical CSS (RTL-correct), is
translation-ready, and is intentionally **neutral** — a client brand restyles it via `brand.json` with no markup
edits.

## Design Language System

`Corex\Ui\DesignSystemCatalog` enumerates the full six-category taxonomy (Foundations, Components, Blocks,
Patterns, Templates, Guidelines) with a `mechanism` per entry, **drift-checked** against the real registered
`corex/*` blocks. Full documentation: the docs-app [Design System section](../../docs-app/src/content/docs/design-system/).

`Corex\Ui\ApprovedComponentInventory` (spec 068) records the approved **Blocks & Components** design inventory —
33 content / 8 WooCommerce / 13 admin / 23 core-UI items — each with its design status and the real delivery
`resolution` that ships it (a `corex/*` block, block style, pattern, admin/runtime stylesheet selector, or an
allowed deferral). A reconciliation test proves every non-deferred item points at an artifact that exists, so
no component can be claimed that the framework does not ship. The admin `.corex-toast` (transient save
confirmation) and `.corex-tooltip` (accessible supplemental affordance) primitives ship token-only in the
corex-core admin shell.

## Manifest

`UiManifest::describe()` enumerates the dynamic blocks (read from their `block.json` files, so it
cannot drift) and the section patterns with their category — for kits/tooling (spec 010) to discover
and compose.

## Tests

```bash
composer test   # headless: dynamic-block renders, token-only assertion, manifest
```

> Block/pattern **registration** and token-only/accessibility structure are covered headlessly.
> The **editor/visual** validity of the pattern markup should be confirmed in a browser.
