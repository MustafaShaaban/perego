/**
 * FieldValue — one stored value, rendered for an operator (#149 item 2).
 *
 * A careers form records the applicant's CV as a URL on the submission. Before this, the reviewer
 * looking at that submission had a document they could see and not open: every admin surface
 * stringified and stopped, so the link was text to select and paste into the address bar. That was
 * a client report, not a hypothetical.
 *
 * **Only `http(s)` becomes a link, and that restriction is the point.** These values are supplied by
 * visitors. A `javascript:` or `data:` string that became an anchor would be a stored-XSS vector
 * aimed squarely at the person reviewing submissions — the one user on the site with a session
 * worth stealing. Anything that is not an absolute http(s) URL stays inert text.
 *
 * `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for the same reason: a followed link must not reach back into the
 * admin session through `window.opener`, and the admin URL is not a referrer worth leaking.
