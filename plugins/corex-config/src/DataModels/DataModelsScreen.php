/**
 * The single home for data: models, records, import, export, and migrations.
 *
 * Records used to live here AND on a separate "Data" screen that rendered the identical explorer
 * from an identical config — two menu entries for one screen. The Data screen is gone and its
 * address redirects here.
 *
 * That consolidation forces the permissions to be honest. MANAGE_DATA and MANAGE_DATA_MODELS are
 * independent (CorexAbilityCatalog: neither implies the other; only MANAGE_ADMIN implies both), and
 * this screen gated on MANAGE_DATA_MODELS while the records explorer inside it reads sources gated
 * on MANAGE_DATA. So a models-only user already got an explorer that could read nothing, and gating
 * the survivor on models alone would have cut off data-only users entirely. The screen therefore
 * admits either ability and each tab asks for the one it actually needs — the same either-ability
 * rule DataRestGateway and DataManagementController already apply to the REST side.
