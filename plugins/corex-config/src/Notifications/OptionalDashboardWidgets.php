/**
 * The optional, opt-in Dashboard widgets (spec 072 US7, T024).
 *
 * The Command Center widget is registered for everyone with CoreX visibility (FR-023). These are the
 * opposite: nothing here appears unless the site asked for it. FR-025 sets four independent
 * conditions, and {@see shouldRegister()} is the one place all four are decided —
 *
 *   - opt-in: absent from the option means absent from the dashboard;
 *   - ability: each widget declares the ability it needs, checked per actor;
 *   - data: never register for an actor who can see nothing, because an empty widget takes space to
 *     say nothing and implies the actor is missing something they are simply not party to;
 *   - mode: a Development-only widget must never reach a Production dashboard.
 *
 * That method is pure so each rule is testable without WordPress, mirroring how LoginRouteGuard
 * separates its decision from its hooks. Everything rendered here reuses the canonical services the
 * full CoreX screens use — no widget queries anything for itself — and every action is a link.
