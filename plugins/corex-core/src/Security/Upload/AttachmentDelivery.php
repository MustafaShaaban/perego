/**
 * The only way to read a file stored by {@see AttachmentStore} (spec 081, FR-009 / FR-015).
 *
 * The file lives outside anything the web server should serve, so it has no working public URL —
 * this route is how an authorised operator opens it. That inversion is the design: **the check
 * happens before a byte is read**, in PHP, on every request, rather than depending on a `.htaccess`
 * the server may or may not honour.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does not do:
 *
 * - **No signed URLs with an expiry.** A signed URL is a bearer token in a browser history, a
 *   referrer header and an email forward. The viewer is already logged in; asking who they are is
 *   cheaper and does not leak.
 * - **No `X-Sendfile`/`X-Accel-Redirect`.** Both are faster and both hand the file back to the web
 *   server's configuration — the thing this class exists because CoreX cannot verify.
