# Corex CLI (`wp corex make:*`)

Stub-based generators that remove repetitive file creation. The generator **engine**
(render + write) is pure PHP and headless-testable; the **WP-CLI layer**
(`MakeCommand`, `CliServiceProvider`) is the only part that touches `WP_CLI` and is
registered only when WP-CLI is present (`class_exists('WP_CLI')`) — Principle IX.

## Requirements

WP-CLI, with the Corex plugins active. Target the install with `--path` when WP-CLI
isn't run from the WordPress root:

```bash
wp corex make:model Invoice --path=wp
```

## Where generated files go

Targets resolve from the Config engine (`config/app.php`, overridable by options or
`.env`):

| Config key | Default | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `app.path` | `''` → falls back to `WP_CONTENT_DIR/corex-app` | base dir for generated files |
| `app.namespace` | `App` | namespace of generated classes |
| `app.prefix` | `corex` | post-type prefix, block name prefix, text domain |

## Commands

### Single-class generators

| Command | Creates | Path |
|---|---|---|
| `wp corex make:model <Name>` | a read-only `Corex\Models\Model` subclass | `<base>/Models/<Name>.php` |
| `wp corex make:repository <Name>` | a repository class | `<base>/Repositories/<Name>Repository.php` |
| `wp corex make:controller <Name>` | a thin controller | `<base>/Controllers/<Name>Controller.php` |
| `wp corex make:service <Name>` | a service class | `<base>/Services/<Name>Service.php` |

The name is normalized to a valid class identifier and the conventional suffix is
applied once (`make:repository Invoice` and `make:repository InvoiceRepository` both
produce `InvoiceRepository`). Existing files are **skipped** unless `--force` is
passed.

```bash
wp corex make:model Invoice
wp corex make:repository Invoice          # → InvoiceRepository
wp corex make:service Billing --force     # overwrite if it exists
```

### `make:block` — a complete dynamic block

```bash
wp corex make:block TeamMember
```

Scaffolds a **complete, registered, working dynamic block** — the same shape the
build pipeline expects (see `packages/build-tools/README.md`):

```
<base>/Blocks/
  team-member/
    block.json     # apiVersion 3, category "corex", editorScript + style wired,
                   #   corex.renderer → App\Blocks\TeamMemberRenderer
    index.js       # registerBlockType + <ServerSideRender>; imports style.scss
    style.scss     # token-only, RTL-correct
  TeamMemberRenderer.php   # implements Corex\Blocks\BlockRenderer (server render)
```

The renderer PHP lives **beside** the block folder in one `Blocks/` directory (the
corex-ui convention) — a single dir name also avoids a `blocks/`-vs-`Blocks/`
collision on case-insensitive filesystems. The name is given in PascalCase; the slug
(`team-member`), title (`Team Member`), block name (`<prefix>/team-member`), CSS
class (`<prefix>-team-member`), and renderer FQCN are all derived from it.

After scaffolding, compile the assets:

```bash
npm run build        # or: npm run start  (watch mode)
```

Existing blocks are **skipped** unless `--force` is passed.

### `make:site` — scaffold a client site

```bash
wp corex make:site Acme                  # lean: plugin + theme + governance
wp corex make:site Acme --starter        # + a runnable example slice + starter-theme assets
```

Generates a complete **client site** under `--path` (default: the current directory + the slug):
a site **plugin** (`acme-site/`, namespace `AcmeSite\`) and **theme** (`acme/`) with the client's own
prefixes (REST `acme/v1`, CSS `--acme-`, options `acme_` — all distinct from Corex), plus governance
docs (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `.gitignore`, `specs/`, `docs/`).

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--starter` | also emit a runnable example (model → repository → service → controller-on-envelope → block → option page → test) + a starter-theme asset setup (`@wordpress/scripts` build, dev source maps, minified prod, hashed `*.asset.php`, an `Assets` url/path/version helper) + a `REMOVE-EXAMPLE.md` guide |
| `--minimal` | force the lean scaffold (no example) — same as the default |
| `--plugin-only` / `--theme-only` | generate just one side |
| `--force` | regenerate (otherwise an existing site is skipped) |
| `--path=<dir>` | the site root |

A name normalizing to `corex` (or empty) is refused, so a client site can never collide with the framework.
Edit only the generated client plugin/theme — never the Corex framework. See the
[client-site guide](../../docs-app/src/content/docs/guides/client-site.md).

### `reset` — return a Corex site to a clean state

```bash
wp corex reset                                   # SOFT reset (default)
wp corex reset --dry-run                          # preview the soft reset (no changes)
wp corex reset --hard --dry-run                   # preview the full reset (no wipe)
wp corex reset --hard                              # REFUSED — missing --yes-i-mean-it
wp corex reset --hard --yes-i-mean-it --yes       # FULL reset → fresh Corex starter
```

Two modes:

- **Soft** (default): deactivates every Corex **add-on** (the framework plugins
  `corex-core`/`corex-blocks`/`corex-forms`/`corex-config` and the theme stay active),
  deletes every `corex_*` option + feature flag, and removes the wizard-seeded demo Home
  page (reverting the front-page settings). It touches **only** Corex's own footprint —
  non-Corex content is never modified.
- **Full / hard** (`--hard`): wipes the database and restores a **fresh Corex starter** —
  a clean WordPress with only the Corex theme active and no add-ons, options, flags, or
  demo content. **This is destructive and irreversible**, so it is gated: it refuses
  unless you pass the typed safeguard `--yes-i-mean-it` (in addition to WP-CLI's `--yes`).
  A new admin password is generated and printed.

`--dry-run` prints the ordered plan for either mode and changes nothing. The decision
logic (the plan + the safety gate) is the pure, unit-tested `Corex\Cli\Reset\ResetPlanner`
+ `ResetGate`; only `ResetExecutor` touches WordPress.

### `security reset-login` — recover protected login access

```bash
wp corex security reset-login
```

Disables CoreX login-protection gates and releases active lockouts so an owner can regain access through the standard
WordPress login URL. It is intentionally narrow:

- disables `enabled` and `block_default_endpoints` in the login-protection settings;
- preserves unrelated settings such as the custom login slug;
- releases active lockouts through the login-attempt store;
- prints the restored `wp-login.php` URL and whether `COREX_LOGIN_UNGUARD` is active;
- never changes users, roles, passwords, content, or WordPress core files.

Use it when a custom login route, default-endpoint protection, or active lockout blocks owner access.

### `doctor` — health check (spec 036)

```bash
wp corex doctor                                   # health report; non-zero exit if critical
```

Runs the Corex health probes — the same checks shown in **Tools → Site Health** (PHP/WordPress
version, a block theme active, `brand.json` present, uploads writable) — and **exits non-zero on a
critical finding**, so it gates CI and works over SSH. The judgement is the pure, unit-tested
`Corex\Health\HealthReport` + probes; the command and the Site Health registration are thin boundaries.

### `version` — stamp a release version (spec 036)

```bash
wp corex version 0.22.0 --dry-run                 # preview which files would change
wp corex version 0.22.0                           # stamp every framework header + COREX_*_VERSION
```

Aligns every framework plugin/theme header and `COREX_*_VERSION` constant to one semver, so the headers
never drift from the release tag. The pure, unit-tested `Corex\Cli\Release\VersionPlan` computes the edits
(returning only files that actually change); the command reads the files and writes (or previews) the plan.

## Adding a generator

Single-class generators extend `Corex\Cli\Generators\Generator` (a stub name, a
suffix, a sub-path, and the placeholder values) and pair with a `*.stub` under
`packages/cli/stubs/`. Register the instance in `CliServiceProvider::boot()`'s
`make:*` map. The multi-file block path is `BlockScaffolder` + the stub set under
`packages/cli/stubs/block/`.
